        <content type="html"><![CDATA[  Why do some startups thrive while others disappear? There are many reasons, but one of the common mistakes is the inability to focus at and navigate the critical phases of a startup: Product-Market Fit, establishing a Business Model, and scaling for Growth. Each phase brings unique challenges and requires a sharp focus. The best resource I found on and startups is . This book breaks down the nuances of each phase, helping you to make educated decisions that increase your startup’s chances of success. If you want to gate a taste of it, watch By the end of it, you’ll have an understanding what you need to do to steer your startup from idea to scalable business with more confidence learnt from the shoulders of a successful serial startup founder. Below are my notes with the key phases for early B2B startups.       PMF: FINDING VALUE FOR USERS  Product-Market Fit is the foundation of any successful startup. Without it, even the most groundbreaking ideas will fail to gain traction—and eventually die. It’s really that simple.  What is PMF?   * Validation: Achieving PMF means proving that your product solves a real    problem for a specific group of users. It’s not about intuition or gut    feelings; this is measured through data only.  * User Retention: One of the strongest indicators of PMF is whether your users    continue to return. Ideally, you should aim for at least 30% of them to    regularly engage with your product—this shows they find ongoing value in your    product.      * Conversion and Feedback: Another critical aspect is understanding why some    users drop off after their first interaction is critical. Reaching out to    these users for feedback will help you to refine your product meets their    needs (or confirm they are not your target audience).  The Importance of Metrics  Your ability to succeed in this phase largely depends on the metrics you track:    * Retention Rate: If your users aren’t coming back, it’s a clear sign you    haven’t nailed PMF. Consider this metric your North Star.      * Cohort Analysis: The next level here is to track how different groups of    users engage with your product over time. This will help you uncover patterns    that signal whether you're moving in the right direction.   * User Feedback: Don’t hesitate to connect with users who didn't return. Their    insights are most valuable for pinpointing areas that need improvement and    for fine-tuning your offering.  When to Move On  Knowing when to move beyond the PMF stage is as important as finding it. You’ll know you’re ready to advance to next phase when you have a core group of loyal, repeatedly coming users, and your product consistently delivers value. What is the key sign? When your first customer returns for a renewal - this is a clear indicator that you’re solving a real problem.         BUSINESS MODEL: TURNING VALUE INTO REVENUE  How do you ensure your startup’s long-term survival? It comes down to building a sustainable business model. Once you’ve reached PMF, your next challenge is figuring out how to monetize the value you’re providing.  What is a Business Model?   * Value Capture: Your business model is how you transform the value your    product delivers into revenue. A good rule of thumb is to aim for capturing    between 10-25% of the value your product generates. If you’re far below this    range, you may struggle to sustain your business.        Market Considerations: It’s also important to ensure the market you’re    targeting is big enough to support your revenue ambitions. Even the best    product can hit a ceiling if the market is too small.  Key Metrics and Strategies   * Revenue per User: This metric tracks how much revenue each customer brings    in. Monitoring this will help you understand whether your pricing is working.  * Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. Lifetime Value (LTV): Your business model    needs to ensure that the lifetime value of a customer far exceeds the cost of    acquiring them. Ideally, your LTV should be at least three times your    CAC—this ratio is critical for long-term profitability.  * Sales Cycle Length: The shorter your sales cycles, the more efficient your    business model is likely to be. Long sales cycles might indicate that your    value proposition needs refining, or that it isn’t compelling enough to    customers.  When to Move On  Crafting a solid business model is about more than just generating revenue—it’s about ensuring your startup can scale and succeed in the long run. Make sure you’re capturing enough value, and that your revenue streams align with your customers’ needs and behaviors.  You’ll know you’re ready to transition into the Growth phase when you’ve successfully figured out how to monetize your product, your sales cycles are streamlined, and you can predict your revenue with consistency. At this point, your focus should shift toward expanding your customer base, all while keeping a close eye on the balance between CAC and LTV.         GROWTH: BALANCING ACQUISITION AND RETENTION         During growth phase, the focus shifts from building and validating to expanding and optimizing. This phase is about ramping up user acquisition, maximizing retention, and ensuring that your business model can handle rapid expansion without faltering.  Key Metrics for Growth   * Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): As you scale, it's crucial to keep a close    eye on CAC. If your acquisition costs start to climb faster than the revenue    each new customer brings in, it’s a signal that your growth strategy might    need rethinking.  * Churn Rate: Minimizing churn is just as important. High churn rates are a    warning that your product isn’t delivering consistent value, and that can    undermine even the most aggressive growth plans.  Strategies for Sustainable Growth  To scale effectively, focus on these strategies:   * Optimize User Acquisition: Whether you’re leveraging viral loops or paid    channels, acquiring users efficiently is vital. Make sure that your marketing    spend is generating a healthy return.   * Enhance User Retention: Growth isn’t just about adding new users; it’s about    keeping them. Invest in features and improvements that encourage long-term    engagement.   * Leverage Data: Use data analytics to track user behavior and continuously    fine-tune your growth strategy. By understanding which channels bring in your    most valuable users, you can allocate resources more effectively.  When to Push for Aggressive Growth        Deciding when to push for aggressive growth depends on how stable your business model is and whether you can scale user acquisition and retention effectively. If your CAC is low, your retention rates are high, and you feel confident that scaling won’t compromise product quality or user experience, then it’s time to hit the gas.   SUMMARY  What’s the ultimate goal for any startup? It’s to create sustainable value, and that requires intentional focus. Focus is everything. Moving too early or too slowly through these phases can be costly.    * PMF: Validate that your product solves a real problem by watching user    retention.  * Business Model: Ensure that you’re capturing enough value.  * Growth: Scale by balancing acquisition and retention.  Validate each step, stay data-driven, and adjust your strategy as needed. If you like this summary, follow me on for similar resources, and go read the full .   ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of software, the strategy can be the difference between success and failure. Yet, bad strategy or a lack of strategy is common. From mistaking goals for a plan to those drowning in slide decks full of vision and mission, without actionable steps, the pitfalls are everywhere. In this fascinating , Richard Rumelt highlights these critical errors, providing insight into why many organizations struggle. This summary of their podcast will delve into what are common examples of a bad strategy and provide tips on crafting good strategies.   INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGY   Strategy is a cohesive response designed to address significant challenges. Effective strategy entails addressing identified high-stakes challenges through a coherent mix of policy and action. It starts with a precise diagnosis of the biggest challenge faced, is followed by a guiding policy that outlines solutions, and culminates in coherent actions aimed at overcoming the challenge. So, if this defines a good strategy, one might wonder, what does a bad strategy look like?   BAD STRATEGY  Richard’s book is perhaps better known for its examples of what not to do in strategy than for its good strategic insights. Many readers find these examples strikingly relevant to their own organizational struggles. Below is a list of common strategic missteps highlighted in his work:   1.  Failure to Face the Challenge: Strategies that fail to clearly identify or      address the core challenges facing the organization often lead to vague      objectives without actionable plans.   2.  Ignoring Obstacles: Strategies that overlook significant barriers or      challenges that could derail the plan often lead to unrealistic      expectations and strategic failures.   3.  Mistaking Goals for Strategy: Setting high-level goals, such as profit      targets or market share increases, without outlining specific actions or      policies to achieve these goals, confuses outcomes with strategic plans.   4.  Fluff: Using jargon or buzzwords might sound impressive but often lacks      clear, practical implications or actionable content. This fluff tends to      obscure the absence of substantive strategy. An extension of this is the      misuse of vision and mission statements as substitutes for actual strategic      planning, where they are presented as strategy without underpinning      actions.   5.  Template-Style Strategy: Adopting generic strategies not tailored to the      company’s specific circumstances can lead to misaligned efforts and wasted      resources.   6.  No Coherent Action Plan: Strategies that list desired outcomes without      linking them to coherent, coordinated actions that can realistically      achieve these outcomes.   7.  The Laundry List: Crafting a strategy composed of a long list of unrelated      tasks or initiatives, which lacks focus and dilutes resources, thereby      making it difficult to achieve significant results in any area.   8.  Neglecting Organizational Dynamics: Crafting strategies that are      incompatible with the company's culture or poorly communicated, leading to      resistance and misalignment.   9.  Misjudging Resources and Competition: Planning based on unrealistic      assumptions about resource availability and underestimating the strength      and strategies of competitors.   10. Short-termism: Focusing solely on short-term gains at the expense of      long-term sustainability.   Effective strategy requires a clear understanding of the competitive landscape, internal capabilities, and adaptable objectives that can respond to changing circumstances. So what is a good strategy?   COMPONENTS OF A GOOD STRATEGY  Diagnosis. Guiding policy. And coherent actions.   Diagnosis involves understanding the nature of the challenge that needs to be addressed. It's about pinpointing the key issue and deciding what aspects of reality to focus on to develop a strategic response. For example, a company may identify that its primary challenge is declining market share due to intensified competition from tech-savvy newcomers.   The guiding policy is the approach chosen to navigate the challenge identified during the diagnosis. It dictates how the challenge will be managed and establishes a framework for subsequent actions. A firm might decide to differentiate its product line through advanced technology and superior customer service as a policy to regain market share.   Coherent actions are the specific steps taken to implement the guiding policy and directly address the challenge identified in the diagnosis. Actions must be well-coordinated and logically consistent to be effective. An example would be developing a new series of tech-enhanced products, training customer service teams to provide exceptional service, and launching a targeted marketing campaign to highlight the unique features of these products.   THE MAGNIFYING GLASS APPROACH  This analogy effectively illustrates the essence of strategy, especially in early startups. Imagine you are trying to light up fire using a magnifying glass. This is similar to bootstrapping a startup with initial customers.     The Magnifying Glass Analogy for Strategy    1. Power (The Sun):       * In strategy, the source of power refers to the organization's unique        strengths or advantages that can be leveraged to address the challenge.        This might be a technological edge, a strong brand reputation, or        exclusive access to certain resources.    2. Focus (The Magnifying Glass):       * The magnifying glass symbolizes the guiding policy within a strategy.        Just as a magnifying glass focuses sunlight into a concentrated beam, the        guiding policy focuses organizational resources and efforts towards a        specific path. This focus ensures that all actions are aligned and aimed        precisely at the challenge.   3. Target (The Black Thread Burned):       * The target in strategy is the challenge or problem identified in the        diagnosis. It's the specific issue that the strategy aims to resolve or        the opportunity it seeks to exploit. Just as the focused sunlight can        ignite a black string faster than a huge wooden log, a well-crafted        strategy directs organizational efforts to change or influence the target        area effectively.   The magnifying glass analogy powerfully illustrates the critical alignment necessary in planning, emphasizing the need to synchronize power, focus, and target to effectively drive desired changes or outcomes. This analogy is particularly resonant in the context of a startup, where resources (or "power") are often limited. In such environments, directing a team's efforts towards highly specific and impactful activities can significantly amplify the effect of these limited resources, much like focusing sunlight through a magnifying glass to burn a thread rather than attempting to set ablaze a large wooden log. Similarly, in a startup, identifying and engaging the right initial user base and concentrating team efforts effectively can accelerate early growth and set the foundation for future success.    DISTINGUISHING GOALS FROM STRATEGY  Goals such as key performance indicators (KPIs), financial targets, or personal ambitions are not strategies because they describe desired outcomes rather than defining the specific means of achieving them. In the interview, Richard provides a personal anecdote to illustrate the difference between ambitions and strategy. He mentions a list of ambitions he had when he was younger, which included desires like wanting to become a top business school professor, drive a Morgan Drophead Plus 4, learn to fly an aircraft, and marry a beautiful woman, among other things. This example highlights that while these are all valid personal ambitions, they do not constitute a strategy because they lack a clear plan for achievement that addresses specific challenges or opportunities.   Here’s why goals alone do not constitute a strategy:   * Goals do not provide a diagnosis of the underlying issues or challenges that    need to be addressed. A strategy begins with a thorough understanding of the    problem, which helps in crafting a focused and effective response. Without    this, goals can be misaligned with the actual needs or challenges of the    organization.   * Goals often state what an organization hopes to achieve (e.g., "increase    revenue by 20%" or "expand market share") but do not specify the actions    required to reach these outcomes. Without a clear plan detailing how these    objectives will be achieved, goals remain aspirational and directionless.A    strategy not only outlines what needs to be achieved but also prioritizes and    sequences specific, coherent actions that are required to meet the goals    within the context of the guiding policy.   * A guiding policy provides a coherent approach to overcoming the identified    challenges, acting as a bridge between the diagnosis and the actions. Goals    without a guiding policy lack a strategic framework to direct decision-making    and resource allocation.   * Goals do not usually consider the constraints or limitations within which an    organization operates. Strategies are developed by taking into account both    the opportunities and the constraints, ensuring that the plans are realistic    and executable.  While goals are necessary for setting direction and measuring performance, strategy is about how to get there.   IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING KEY PROBLEMS  An effective strategy focuses on problems that are significant to the organization's success and within its capacity to address, rather than focusing on obvious-looking goals. Here what that is composed of.   Important Problems: These are challenges that have significant impact on the organization's performance or strategic direction. They are critical in that solving them would lead to substantial improvements or advantages for the organization. Importance is determined by the potential impact on the organization's objectives, such as improving market position, enhancing operational efficiency, or driving innovation.   Addressable Problems: These are challenges that the organization has the capabilities to solve or at least make significant progress on. Addressability involves having or being able to develop the necessary resources, technologies, and competencies to tackle the problem effectively. Unlike setting goals, which often describe desired end states (like "increase market share by 10%"), focusing on important and addressable problems involves a dynamic process of understanding and acting on core challenges. It's about diagnosing and then strategically responding to these challenges with coherent actions that directly tackle the issues at hand. This approach ensures that strategy is not just about hitting targets or milestones but is fundamentally about changing the conditions or dynamics that limit the organization's success.   Strategy is not about listing everything you want to accomplish; rather, it's about identifying the most pressing challenges that are blocking the path to these ambitions, and then formulating a coherent plan of action to overcome these obstacles. This requires diagnosing the real issues at hand, setting a guiding policy that addresses these issues, and then executing coherent actions that directly tackle the identified problems.   Final Thoughts  Good strategy is not easy, and bad strategy is prevalent. A well-formulated strategy is key for navigating challenges. It requires a clear understanding of the issues at hand, a well-defined guiding policy, and precise actions that are directly linked to overcoming these challenges. Just as the magnifying glass analogy teaches us to focus our power precisely on the target, so must our strategic efforts be sharply focused on the goal. To learn more about avoiding these common pitfalls and crafting effective strategies, explore Richard’s book.   ]]></content>

        <updated>2024-04-28T18:35:00.021Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Finding product-market fit (PMF) is arguably the most critical challenge faced by startups. Navigating the path to PMF can often feel like moving through a labyrinth, with each turn posing potential setbacks or breakthroughs. The PMF framework is designed to guide startups through the various stages of validating and scaling their product in the market. It helps founders identify where they are in the product-market fit journey, what their immediate focus should be, and how to recognize if they are on the right track or if adjustments are needed. The PMF framework is divided into four distinct levels, each representing a stage in a startup's lifecycle:      1. Nascent: Focus on identifying a critical problem and delivering a solution     that is deeply satisfying to a small group of customers.   2. Developing: Transition from initial traction to a scalable business model by     increasing the customer base and establishing reliable demand generation     processes.   3. Strong: Scale business operations efficiently while maintaining product     quality that meets market demands.   4. Extreme: Achieve widespread market acceptance, continuously optimize the     product offerings, and explore new market opportunities for further     expansion.     The table below provides a look at each level, featuring key characteristics such as company and financial metrics, primary focus areas, benchmarks for measuring progress, and danger signals that might indicate potential issues.             Product-Market Fit Framework Summary (click to enlarge)     Navigating it means you've successfully developed a product that meets a substantial market demand and is capable of sustaining growth. Achieving PMF is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that involves three dimensions: Satisfaction, Demand, and Efficiency. These dimensions evolve over the lifetime of a startup, each taking precedence at different stages of the company's growth.      * Satisfaction: In the early stages, ensuring customer satisfaction is    paramount. Founders must concentrate on solving a critical problem that is    important and urgent for a select group of customers. This involves creating    a product or service that not only addresses the problem effectively but also    delivers a superior experience compared to existing solutions. As startups    move to higher levels of PMF, maintaining satisfaction remains crucial but    becomes part of a broader strategy that includes scaling and optimizing    operations  * Demand: As a startup transitions from the nascent to the developing stage,    the focus shifts towards generating and scaling demand. At this point, the    product or service has been validated with an initial customer base, and the    challenge becomes attracting a larger audience. This involves fine-tuning    marketing strategies, diversifying channels, and increasing market outreach    to capture a broader segment of potential customers. Successful demand    generation is marked by an increasing customer base and the establishment of    repeatable sales processes.  * Efficiency: In the later stages of PMF, particularly when a startup reaches    strong and extreme levels, efficiency becomes a critical focus. At these    stages, the startup must optimize its operations to handle the scaling    business effectively. This includes streamlining processes, reducing costs,    improving operational throughput, and leveraging technology to enhance    productivity. Efficiency gains are crucial for sustaining growth at scale,    managing large teams, and expanding to new markets without compromising on    quality or customer satisfaction.       Focus areas during the stage in a startup's lifecycle (click to enlarge)   The PMF framework is not a roadmap; it's a diagnostic tool that helps founders make strategic decisions and pivot when necessary, ensuring they stay aligned with market needs and business objectives. Through these evolving focus areas, the PMF framework not only helps startups understand what is required at each stage but also prepares them to anticipate changes in focus as they grow.     This amazing framework was thoroughly outlined by during a session on Lenny's Product Growth Podcast. Impressed by the depth and practicality of the discussion, I felt compelled to distill and document the key points to better understand and apply these principles. For a comprehensive exploration of the and to hear from Todd Jackson himself, visit for the full episode. Todd's expertise and clarity in presenting this framework make it an extremely useful resource for any startup looking to navigate the complex journey to market fit.]]></content>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - July 03, 2023</h1>
      <p>Hello to our dear JBoss community.
We, the editorial team, have noticed a downward trend in our readership and have made the decision to no longer carry on.
There are many great blogs out there and the JBoss community of projects is producing a lot of great content for you to learn from.
However, with the steady decline in our editorial views, we no longer feel the effort we put into distilling the blogs and tutorials is having the sort of impact that we would hope.
Writing up the editorials is more work than you might expect and takes a good chunk of time that we could devote to doing our actual jobs or hacking on code.</p>
<p>It has been a great ride and we wish you all the best.
We thought about doing a sort of highlight reel to round up some of our favourite blog posts and moments doing the editorial, but realized probably no one is going to read it.
So let’s stop shouting into the void and carry on building cool stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything and goodbye.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Let's express life through its finite ingredients. There are three resources in life that everything else depends on. Every time you waste any of them, they're gone forever. These are time, energy, and focus.   TIME  Time is the one variable that nobody has any control over. There are 24 hours in a day, 365 days in a year. Time offers the same equal consistency to everybody, but at different lengths. We are born, we live, and we die. All you can do is maximise the other variables in the time given to you, in a way meaningful to you.   ENERGY  Being alive is a prerequisite, but not sufficient to reach happiness. Given a lifetime, to maximise your purpose and happiness, depends on your energy levels. Energy is the ability to do things, physically or mentally. Having a body sufficiently healthy that will enable you to pursue your purpose. For some, this can be a physically strong body, having a good sleep, healthy diet, and regular exercise. For others, it can be sufficient to be able to get up from the bed and hold a pen. And for some even the ability to express your thoughts through a computer device (such as Stephen Hawking). Energy levels vary from person to person, but so are the energy needs. Energy is not a "have or have not" constant like life is, it is rather a variable that tends that changes every moment, and tends to go down with age. Energy is the multiplier that lets you get the best out of the time given to you.   FOCUS  Being lucky to be alive, and having sufficient energy, gives the optionality to spend your attention in many ways. Focus is about how we use our time and energy in a directed way. It is the ability to concentrate our attention in a direction that makes us happy, or spread and waste in the universe in a way benefiting others or nobody.   Focus is the variable that we have most control over, and the variable that has the biggest power to change our life. Used in a purposeful way, even in short lifespan and limited energy levels, it has led to personal fulfilments, or human achievements that are remembered throughout millennials. Used purposelessly, can lead to wasted long life full of energy, and many regrets in a death bed.    THE HAPPINESS FORMULA  If time is a yes/no constant, and the energy level is a multiplier for every moment, then focus is the exponent of all. Every moment, we are alive, we have a certain energy level that we can use for something purposeful or waste for nothing. Then we have recharge again. Every moment we have the ability to focus our energy to things that matter to us, or waste it aimlessly. Life happiness is the sum of all moments we had, with sufficient energy to help us focus on things that makes us happy.    Happiness is the sum of all finite moments where we focus our energy towards our purpose   Every time we waste these finite resources, they're gone forever. Make sure you are alive first, healthy and energised second, and also focused on what makes you happy. These variables build on top of each other and require a delicate balance. Focus too much on one thing, and you may lose your life in an instant. Ignore your health, and your energy levels will suffer hindering the ability to focus. Do everything right, and still a meteor can hit you and end it all. There is no guarantee, or fairness in any of these, only the awareness of its working. This formula is re presentation of how these finite resources can be transformed into happiness in the equation called life.]]></content>

<p>Kafka transactions play a vital role in guaranteeing the reliability and integrity of data, making them a pivotal component of the Kafka platform. Nevertheless, these benefits are accompanied by a trade-off in terms of decreased throughput and added latency, necessitating potential adjustments. Neglecting to monitor transactions that remain unresolved can adversely affect the availability of the service. This article sheds some light on this topic.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welocme back everyone!
I don’t know about where you happen to be, but where I’m living, we had the second largest snow storm in recorded weather history.
I’ve been digging out my driveway and front door for a couple of days.
Needless to say, it has been a bit cold here.</p>
<p>Also, my thoughts go out to those affected by the war between Russia and Ukraine, on this one year anniversary.
Please stay as safe as you can.</p><p></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[HOW DOES KNATIVE PROJECT COMPARE TO DAPR?  Both and projects help create and run cloud-native applications on Kubernetes, but differ in important aspects. I thought I'd quickly share where these projects overlap and complement each other from a user point of view. If you prefer, you can read this post as a twitter too.     Dapr vs Knative   TLDR: Knative extends Kubernetes with serverless containers (scaling to and from 0) and helps you connect applications declaratively. Dapr helps developers implement reliable connected distributed applications quickly.   COMMUNITY  Knative originated from Google, whereas Dapr from Microsoft. Today both projects are incubating at CNCF. Both projects have growing communities and are within top 20 active CNCF projects (Dapr #10 and Knative #17)   Community statistics   See the full CNCF project statistics .  PRIMARY FOCUS AREA  ➤Knative extends Kubernetes with serverless containers by taking care of runtine networking (sync/async), autoscaling (to/from zero), and app revision tracking.   ➤Dapr helps developers create reliable connected distributed applications quickly. It doesn’t manage the lifecycle of the application, instead it runs next to the applications.   TARGET USER  ➤Knative serving can be used by Ops to auto-scale and release apps (with traffic splitting). Knative eventing and functions can be used by devs to build, deploy apps, and connect external systems and event-driven containers.    ➤Dapr is toolkit designed primarily for developers. Developers use APIs & SDKs to interact with Dapr and offload responsibilities such as: pub/sub, state access, stateful service invocation, resiliency, etc. There are design time and runtime benefits for architects and operations teams respectively as described .   SUPPORTED PLATFORMS  ➤Knative runs only on top of Kubernetes and a network layer such as Kourier, Istio, Contour.   ➤Dapr can run on Kubernetes, as well as on-premises and edge devices (such as the ).   For local dev, Knative requires Kubernetes, whereas Dapr can also run on Docker, or as a single binary only.  DEPLOYMENT MODEL  Both projects have operator, helm chats, CLI that help with installation and operating the control planes on Kubernetes.    ➤On the data plane side, Dapr is a sidecar that gets injected into the application pod. The application interacts with Dapr over well-defined APIs...   ➤Knative dictates how the application is defined and run on Kubernetes by creating deployments, pods, configmaps, and networking configurations. It injects a transparent sidecar into every pod to measure network activity. And has an activator to hold off requests while scaling from zero.  DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE  ➤Knative uses Kubernetes CRDs for defining an app (called Knative Service) composed of container, configuration, revision. It also offers CRDs that can define how events (CloudEvents) flow between these services, subscribe to a broker. And functions-centric CLI.   ➤Dapr offers HTTP and gRPC APIs for Service invocation, Pub/Sub, State, Workflows, Bindings, Configuration, Secrets, Distributed lock, called building blocks. Devs use an HTTP/gRPC client, or SDKs for 8+ languages to interact with the above APIs.  OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE  ➤Knative serving helps Ops with releasing, auto-scaling, configuring services. Knative eventing with abstracting the broker.    ➤Dapr helps Ops with monitoring, securing, and increasing resiliency of services, as well as cloud infrastructure abstraction.   TOP FEATURES  ➤Knative Scale to 0 Autoscaling Traffic splitting App definition Pub/sub Connectors Function CLI   ➤Dapr Pub/sub Service-to-service interaction with resiliency, key/value access, Actors, Connectors, Security (mTLS, Auth), Config/Secrets, Workflows, Distributed Lock APIs.  FEATURE OVERLAP  The primary overlap is around pub/sub capabilities. Both projects offer async interactions between applications by abstracting the broker & using CloudEvents format. Both projects have connectors and ability to subscribe apps to the broker.    ➤Knative defines these w/ CRDs & over HTTP.    ➤Dapr supports HTTP/gRPC, using CRDs and code.   SWEET SPOT  ➤Knative: autoscaling containers (to and from zero). ➤Dapr: event-driven and stateful service interactions.   Upcoming hot feature:    ➤Knative: function development.  ➤Dapr: workflows based orchestration.   SUMMARY  Those are the key differences between Dapr and Knative I'm aware of.  If you know other differences, share those on the twitter . We are actively working on both projects and exploring how they complement each other and integrate with the greater CNCF .]]></content>

At Red Hat, I had the opportunity to with with exceptional teams on projects such as Debezium, Data Virtualization, Apicurio, Apache Camel, and Strimzi, and helped build Red Hat's . Kafka is more than just a fast message broker, it is a comprehensive ecosystem of various complementary management and development tools and managed services. Through my learning, , and exploration of the vast , I compiled a list of over 120 active Kafka projects I encountered. Here is a sneak peek some of these projects, with the full data set available in the provided .   Apache Kafka landscape projects  The projects are organized into main categories of the Kafka ecosystem, including Kafka distributions, stream processors, client libraries, connectors, schema registry, replicator, rest proxy, and management tools. Each project includes information on its license, programming language, and deployment types. Additionally, statistics such as GitHub stars or downloads are provided too, but it should be noted that these might have become outdated. A simple report generated from the list is available for reference.   Apache Kafka project stats  Discovering other active projects within the Apache Kafka ecosystem can be time-consuming.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As the field of IT continually evolves, there is a constant stream of new software architectures, development techniques, and tools. Some examples of these include microservices, micro frontends, zero trust, service mesh, and data mesh, you mesh it. Despite the apparent diversity of these technologies and approaches, they are all connected by a common trend: the unbundling of technology stacks and teams. This trend involves breaking down systems into smaller, independent components and organizing work into smaller, more focused teams in order to achieve greater flexibility, and modularity.      The unbundling of the tech stack     How come each of these represent unbundling?   * Microservices emerged as a response to the limitations of monolithic    architecture, which can be inflexible and difficult to scale and maintain as    an application grows. By breaking a monolithic application into smaller,    independent services, it becomes possible to develop, deploy, and scale each    part of the application independently, leading to faster development cycles    and greater flexibility.  * Hexagonal architecture was developed to improve the flexibility and    maintainability of 3-tier applications by decoupling components and providing    standardized interfaces for interacting with them.  * Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software development approach that can help    break down a monolithic application into smaller, loosely-coupled modules    that represent different business domains or contexts.  * Micro frontends architecture is a design approach in which a large,    monolithic frontend application is broken down into smaller, independent    modules that can be developed and deployed separately.   * JAMstack decouples the frontend and backend of an application by separating    the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the user interface from the    server-side code and databases that power the application, allowing easier    maintenance as changes to one part of the system do not necessarily require    changes to the other.  * A service mesh decouples the networking responsibilities of a distributed    application, such as routing, load balancing, and service discovery, from the    application itself, allowing developers to focus on building business logic    and features without worrying about the underlying network infrastructure.  * Similar to microservices, data mesh involves decomposing a large, complex    system into smaller, independent components. It decomposes data governance    and management practices into smaller, independent components that can be    implemented and enforced consistently across different data sources and    systems.  * The 2 pizza team model is a strategy for organizing teams and work in    organizations that advocates for smaller teams able to respond to changes    more quickly, have better communication and collaboration, can make faster    decisions and solve problems more efficiently.  The end result of every tech trend is unbundling. Unbundling of technology stacks into independent components and teams into smaller, more focused teams likely to spread into all other areas. After frontend, data, networking, security, what do you think is the next area of unbundling? in working on and unbundling integration.

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - December, 29th 2022</h1>
      <p><em>Happy Holidays!</em></p>
<p><em>Welcome to our last installment of JBoss Editorial for 2022! As we are about to let this year behind us, it’s time to look back and review our biggest achievement of the past twelve months, but also look ahead to 2023 and what is as in store for the JBoss community!</em></p>
<p>In the previous years, it was Mark Little who wrote this last editorial, often sharing his thoughts on the JBoss community accomplishments and the exciting challenges of the next year. Needless to say, I have impossible shoes to fill in for here! So, I’m not even trying to :), especially as I certainly don’t have the same overview that Mark has on our industry. Also, I will not list all of the milestones the JBoss community achieve. There were simply too many of them to do so, from <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/road-to-quarkus-3/">Quarkus reaching its 200th release and its third major version</a>, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2022/11/09/WildFly27-Final-Released/">Wildfly implementing the latest version of the Jakarta EE specification</a> or <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2022/state-of-open-source">Keycloak named by GitHub one of the top projects in 2022</a>. The only one I could really discuss is the success of my own personal project, integrating as much as possible the JBoss community famous projects into Ansible (<a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/wildfly/">Wildfly</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/infinispan/">Infinispan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/keycloak">Keycloak</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq">AMQ</a>), both upstream (with the collection available on <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?deprecated=false&amp;keywords=middleware_automation&amp;order_by=-relevance&amp;page=1">Ansible Galaxy</a>) and downstream (on <a href="https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/?page_size=10&amp;view_type=list&amp;page=1&amp;keywords=redhat%20java">Ansible Automation Hub</a> for Red Hat customers). One of those extensions is now even part, as a technical preview feature, of the latest release of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/12/22/automate-jboss-web-server-deployment-red-hat-certified-content-collection-jws">Red Hat JWS</a>! But, once more, this is only one of the numerous achievements of this year.</p>
<p>This short inventory of mine is probably as incomplete as it is biased, but it does make my case: yet again, the JBoss community has been thriving, releasing new version often, and producing quality content (blogs, videos or presentation). I, for one, can’t wait to see what will come out of it next year, and if you are too, well, I have good news. You are already in the right place ;)! The JBoss Editorial will continue and will keep you inform, as much as we can, of everything happening!</p>
<p><em>That’s all folks! Please join us again in two weeks for another installment of our JBoss editorial!</em></p>

<h2 id="_quarkus_still_going_strong">Quarkus, still going strong</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>On top of the recent releases, of the past few weeks, the Quarkus community took the time to publish an article to present the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-support-for-aws-lambda-snapstart/">Quarkus for AWS Lambda Snapstart</a>. If you have any interest in Quarkus or cloud development, this is certainly a must read!</p>
<p>Last, but not the least, two more, deep articles about Quarkus : one on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/reactive-crud-performance-case-study/">Reactive CRUD performance case study</a> and the other on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/redis-job-queue-reloaded/">Redis Job Queue - Reloaded</a> (a followup on Clément’s previous article on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/redis-job-queue/">How to implement a job queue with Redis</a>.</p>

<p>The last two weeks have seen the release of some introductions and presentations articles that are worth mentioning. The first one, my favorite because it talks about an unsung hero of the Wildfly ecosystem, is about : <a href="https://jberet.github.io/jberet-intro/">Introducing The Java Batch Processing API And JBeret Implementation</a>. If you have no idea what this is about, please go check it out, this is bound to make your life easier!</p>
<p>After this is definitely this humble article entitled <a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/java-ee/jakarta-ee/a-maven-starter-for-jakarta-ee-projects/">A Maven starter for Jakarta EE projects</a>. Indeed, Maven has been at the heart of Java (and thus JBoss) technology for a long while now (around two decades), so such an introduction, for newcomers and experienced developers alike, is certainly nice to see.</p>

<p>It’s not strictly speaking JBoss community, but I’m too proud of this baby of mine to keep quiet about it. Since over a year, I’ve been part of an initiative to provide better integration between the automation tool Ansible and many of the middleware solutions being developed by the JBoss Community. We are quite to already have Ansible collections (extension for Ansible) that ease the setup of <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/wildfly">Wildfly</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/infinispan">Infinispan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/keycloak">Keycloak</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq">AMQ Broker</a>.</p>
<p>We also provide, for the community, a collection for <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/jws">Red Hat JBoss Web Server (JWS)</a> and we are very proud and happy to announce that this collection is now also offered, as tech preview, as part of the last release of Red Hat JWS 5.7: <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_web_server/5.7/html/red_hat_ansible_certified_content_collection_1.2_for_red_hat_jboss_web_server_release_notes/index">Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collection 1.2 for Red Hat JBoss Web Server</a>.</p>
<p>If you are curious about the potential of those collections and how Ansible can help when you deploy JBoss runtimes, please check this (awesome) demo on <a href="https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/rhaf22/SessionCatalog2022/session/16579300056760019EPY">Ansible Fest Session Catalog: Managing your Red Hat Middleware estate from the edge to the cloud with Ansible</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 22 September 2022</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p><em>Hi everyone and welcome to the latest installment of JBoss editorial! Today’s stars of the show: Quarkus and KIE (Kogito/Drools)</em></p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus">Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quarkus is quite busy this month! Just yesterday, the project released <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-2-12-3-final-released/">Quarkus 2.12.3.Final</a>, the third round of bugfixes and performance enhance of for the 2.12, which we mentioned in our previous editorial. But that’s not all, Quarkus tooling also got some love with the release of <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.13.0/">Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.13.0 released!</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the publication of new software and bugfixes, James Cobb also took the time to publish the 24th installment of the <a href="https://quarkus.io/newsletter/24/">Quarkus Newsletter</a>, a must-read for anyone who wants to follow or play with Quarkus! And to this point, an interesting new player has joined the project’s community: <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/aphp-user-story/">Quarkus adoption by APHP (Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris)</a>!</p>
<p>Of course, if you are already familiar with Quarkus, you may want something more technical to quench your thirst and Clément Escoffier has just the article for you: <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/redis-job-queue/">How to implement a job queue with Redis</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_kie">KIE</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>KIE community has been quite active too in the last days and produced quite an amount of interesting articles about their technology. First, we’ll suggest you’ll dive into this one about <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/09/creating-your-first-cloud-agnostic-serverless-application-with-java.html">Creating your first cloud-agnostic serverless application with Java</a>. It’s a good place to start!</p>
<p>Another one, called <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/09/new-visualizer-for-the-serverless-workflow-editor.html">New visualizer for the Serverless Workflow Editor</a> provides a nice overview of this new tool and we’ll certainly learn more about it and use it. If you are more interested into technical details and implementation, you are in luck, there is a rather detailed overview of the <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/09/efesto-refactoring-technical-details.html">Efesto refactoring</a>.</p>
<p>Wait, that’s not all! Check out this article, and the video it links to: <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/09/transparent-ml-integrating-drools-with-aix360.html">Transparent ML, integrating Drools with AIX360</a>!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p><a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2022/08/04/wildfly-maven-docker/">Use the wildfly-maven-plugin to create a Docker image of your application</a>, by By Jeff Mesnil</p>
<p>Jeff explains how to use the <code>wildlfy-maven-plugin</code> and the new WildFly runtime image to build container images.
The WildFly Maven plugin, currently in beta with Final planned for WildFly 27, offers a new, and very compelling, architecture to control the full runtime from the application <code>pom.xml</code>.
Developers control the full customization of WildFly using feature packs, packaging scripts, and other artifacts.
This approach ensures that the runtime fits the user’s application.
Creating a container image is simply a matter of putting it in a runtime image that contains OpenJDK.</p>
<p>The WildFly team are starting an open conversation to bring additional synergies between the Docker and S2I images for WildFly that could benefit the whole community.
The team are aiming to bring new capabilities, additional architectures (in particular <code>linux/arm64</code>), and newer versions of the JDK to all WildFly images.
Be sure to check out Jeff’s post and find out how you can get involved!</p>

<p>Francesco takes a look at the Jakarta Bean Validation specification which allows you to express constraints on your model and create custom ones in an extensible way.
His detailed post shows you how to write a constraint once and use it in any application layer.
Given that Bean validation is layer agnostic, meaning that you can use the same constraint from the presentation to the business model layer.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2022/08/kogito-rules-drools-with-java-inheritance.html">Kogito Rules (Drools) with Java Inheritance</a>, by Jeff Taylor</p>
<p>In this article, Jeff explains how Kogito rules services can reason over application domain model facts that are represented using plain old Java objects, or POJOs, that use standard Java inheritance.
DRL rules files can use POJOs as well as client applications that call the Kogito rules services.</p>
<p>Jeff explores two approaches for sharing Java subclasses between a Kogito rules service and a client application.
The first approach isolates objects from each subclass into a JSON array while the second approach uses Jackson inheritance annotations to embed objects from each subclass for REST API calls that serialize and deserialize POJOs to and from JSOn.</p>

<h3 id="_secure_kubernetes_certificates_with_cert_manager_and_dekorate">Secure Kubernetes certificates with cert-manager and Dekorate</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/07/19/secure-kubernetes-certificates-cert-manager-and-dekorate">Secure Kubernetes certificates with cert-manager and Dekorate</a> by Jose Carvajal Hilario, Anna-Maria Mihalceanu, and Charles Moulliard.</p>
<p>Managing SSL certificates for your cloud native apps can sometimes get a little tricky. <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">Cert-manager</a>,  a popular tool for cloud-native certificate management helps makes this task a lot easier. But before they can start using it, developers need to deal with creating custom resources that cert-manager requires. Enter <a href="https://dekorate.io/">Dekorate</a>, the tool that significantly decreases the complexity of managing custom resource for Kubernetes and OpenShift. This walkthrough demonstrates how Dekorate automatically creates cert-manager custom resources from annotations in your code. You can then install these resources in a project on your cluster and use them to secure the REST endpoints of your application with TLS. The article provides rich code examples for every step, and also an example application project based on Spring Boot that you can use to follow along with the walkthrough.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_new_http_clients_a_java_generator_and_more_in_fabric8_6_0_0">New HTTP clients, a Java generator, and more in Fabric8 6.0.0</h3>

<p>The Fabric8 Kubernetes client has been making cloud-native development with Java easier for years. After more than five months of intensive work, the release of Fabric8 6.0.0 brings a host of innovative features and capabilities to the core components and utilities in the Fabric8 suite. Steven Hawkins and Andrea Peruffo show off some the coolest features and important bugfixes that the new release has to offer. Check out their article to see the highlights</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/java/how-to-use-java-mission-control-to-monitor-java-apps/">How to use Java Mission Control to monitor Java apps</a> by Francesco Marchioni</p>
<p>Those of you with an interest in monitoring the performance of your Java apps will find Francesco’s post especially informative. The article focuses on Java Flight Recorder (JFR), a JVM monitoring tool that also powers the recently released <a href="https://cryostat.io/">Cryostat</a> project. In addition to offering  insights into the JFR user experience compared to competing tools like JConosle and VisualVM (which he covered in earlier articles), Francesco also provides a quickstart guide for spinning up JFR with Java Mission Control to monitor a Wildfly server.</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/07/27/saas-security-kubernetes-environments-layered-approach#">SaaS security in Kubernetes environments: A layered approach</a> by Alex Kubacki</p>
<p>In his most recent article, Alex Kubacki analyzes recommended practices for securing software-as-a-service applications. Opening with the argument that if you want to truly secure your applications, you must secure every layer of your application stack (all the way from the hardware to the container network interface), Alex moves on to break down the security concerns specific to each layer. He gives particular attention to the cluster and networking layers, where he highlights the benefits of recently released projects, including Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes and the more recent networking security innovations in OpenShift.</p>

<h3 id="_how_to_convert_a_web_application_to_software_as_a_service">How to convert a web application to Software-as-a-Service</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/06/16/how-convert-web-application-software-service#">How to convert a web application to Software-as-a-Service</a> by Bob Reselman</p>
<p>Bob Reselman delves into the "brownfield" approach to redeveloping your web application into a SaaS platform.
Starting off with a well-laid out example business scenario, Bob walks you through the key steps of the process from analyzing your business logic patterns, separating configuration from code, picking an appropriate service architecture, to leveraging the benefits offered by containerization and Kubernetes to ensure that you’ll always be able to scale your services to match the growth of your business.</p>

<h3 id="_multi_cloud_storage_strategies_for_saas_applications">Multi-cloud storage strategies for SaaS applications</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/06/23/multi-cloud-storage-strategies-saas-applications#">Multi-cloud storage strategies for SaaS applications</a> by Michael Hrivnak</p>
<p>In the fourth entry to the ongoing <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/05/18/saas-architecture-checklist-kubernetes"><em>SaaS architecture checklist</em></a> blog series Michael Hrivnak compares software-defined storage (SDS) technologies that help developers create optimized data storage solutions for use in multi-tenant cloud environments.
The first part of Michael’s article deals with the broader technical consideration of how SDS can help developers minimize platform-specific development work, followed by an overview of Red Hat’s current cloud storage technology offerings. In the latter section, Michael provides some insight into combining these offerings to create solutions that provide customers with self-scaling, self-managed, low-latency data storage capabilities.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_cross_site_scripting_explanation_and_prevention_with_go">Cross-site scripting: Explanation and prevention with Go</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/06/28/cross-site-scripting-explanation-and-prevention-go#">Cross-site scripting: Explanation and prevention with Go</a> by Sandipan Roy</p>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks have recently become a topic of interest among application security experts in the cloud native developer community. In his tutorial, Sandipan breaks down the mechanism of executing an XSS attack using malicious JavaScript elements and follows up by outlining 3 strategies for coding in Go that you can use to protect your applications against different types of XSS attacks (Sandipan mentions Stored, Reflected and DOM-based XSS attacks).
The tutorial is richly supplemented by code examples and plenty of additional information context.
Even though this article is a little outside our usual focus area, it is definitely worth a read, especially for those of you interested in buffing up your application security knowledge.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_to_build_graphql_applications_with_quarkus">How to build GraphQL applications with Quarkus</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/soa-cloud/quarkus/how-to-build-graphql-applications-with-quarkus/">How to build GraphQL applications with Quarkus</a> by Francesco Marchioni</p>
<p>In a follow-up to his <a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/eclipse/eclipse-microservices/getting-started-with-graphql-using-java-applications/">earlier article</a> about GraphQL on WildFly, Francesco is back with another tutorial, this time about GraphQL and Quarkus.
The article opens with a brief discussion of the advantages that GraphQL’s schema based data access model has over REST APIs. Francesco  then moves on to showing how you can use <a href="https://code.quarkus.io">code.quarkus.io</a> to create a Quarkus application that supports GraphQL using the MicroProfile-compliant SmallRye GraphQL extensions. The test of the tutorial is a step-by-step guide to writing the service class of the application and a GraphQL API class that handles the Query and Mutation operations supported by GraphQL. At this point, Francesco offers a bit of comparison between the different ways that data access operations work in GraphQL as opposed to REST.
The tutorial ends with sections detailing how you can test your applications using either the GraphQL UI provided by the extension, or the SmallRye MicroProfile GraphQL client API.
In a manner typical of most of Francesco’s tutorials, this one also contains a link to a repository with the code for this example project.
And those of you interested in learning more about GraphQL in Quarkus, check out <em>Quarkus Insights</em> episode #93. You can find the link to it in the <em>Videos</em> section of this week’s editorial.</p>

<h2 id="_net_core_client_for_infinispan">.Net core client for Infinispan</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2022/03/22/dotnetcore-0-0-3-beta">Infinispan .Net Core Client</a>, by Vittorio Rigamonti</p>
<p>Vittorio Rigamonti has made a beta release of his .Net core client that allows access to remote caches on Infinispan clusters.
The client provides .Net core applications with the performance benefits of in-memory data storage.
Combined with the Protobuf data encoding Vittorio’s client also gives .Net core applications data interoperability with Java applications that can access the same Infinispan caches.
Using Protobuf with the .Net core client lets you perform remote queries as an added bonus!</p>
<p>Go check out Vittorio’s post and use his <a href="https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/tree/main/Infinispan.Hotrod.Application">sample application</a> to get started coding.
While you’re at it, you might find Vittorio’s other blog post on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2022/01/21/dotnet-core-query">performing remote queries</a> useful.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_inside_out_event_streaming_with_microservice_architectures">Inside out event streaming with microservice architectures</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2022/04/turning-microservices-inside-out.html">Turning Microservices Inside-Out</a>, by Bilgin Ibryam</p>
<p>This excellent read from Bilgin starts with recent ideas about the design of relational databases and their place in the event-driven world of microservice architectures.
Bilgin makes his point that, rather than replacing relational databases with event streams, the inside out design principle is better applied to the service level.
Using traditional databases with an event-driven approach allows you to combine the best of both technologies but requires a deliberate focus on APIs.
From there Bilgin explains the flow of events through outbound and inbound APIs and how a "connecting tissue" such as Debezium can help you effectively bring relational databases into event-driven microservices.</p>

<h2 id="_camel_quarkus_the_swiss_knife_of_integration">Camel Quarkus: the Swiss knife of integration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/camel-quarkus-effortless-apis/">Riding Camel Quarkus: effortless APIs</a>, by Bruno Meseguer</p>
<p>Bruno showcases Camel Quarkus in an extensive post that will leave anyone working on service integration how they could live without it.</p>
<p>Using the OpenAPI specification as an example Bruno explains how to use Camel Quarkus to connect to an HTTP service and transform data in a few effortless steps.
There’s a lot to discover in his post and Bruno even walks you through a second iteration of his application in which he reduces the path to integration even further.</p>
<p>I think by the end Bruno proves his point, that Camel Quarkus really is a Swiss knife for service integration.
He offers a compelling look at how reducing integration overhead lowers maintenance costs and accelerates development cycles for rapid functionality growth.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quickly_debug_and_profile_mysql_databases">Quickly debug and profile MySQL databases</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p><a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/jbossas/jboss-datasource/how-to-trace-jdbc-statements-performance-in-mysql/">How to trace JDBC Statements performance in MySQL</a>, by Francesco Marchioni</p>
<p>Francesco shows us how to quickly debug and profile SQL statements with Java applications using the MySQL JDBC driver.
Using the WildFly CLI Francesco adds a JDBC connection to MySQL database in a container in a few simple steps.
After creating the datasource he demonstrates the <code>hibernate.show_sql</code> option in the application’s <code>persistence.xml</code>.
Once that’s done you can find all sorts of useful information about SQL statements in your logs.
You’re all set to debug and tune!</p>

<p>Sadly, we have to start our editorial with a less-than-ideal piece of news. In case, you somehow missed, be aware that some vulnerabilities have been found in Log4J. Being one of the most used Java library, it is a rather critical issue. Please take look at this article to know <a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/jbossas/jboss-log/how-to-handle-cve-2021-44228-in-java-applications/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-handle-cve-2021-44228-in-java-applications">How to fix Log4j CVE-2021-44228</a>.</p>
<p>Some other projects from the JBoss community may also have been impacted. Please check any project you are currently using and see if, like <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/12/kie-log4j2-exploit-cve-2021-44228.html">KIE</a> or <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/12/13/infinispan-log4j-cve-releases">InfiniSpan</a>, they have provided information on the impact of the vulnerability.</p>

It is an all day hackathon celebrating Open Source technologies and allowing participants to learn about Open Source and contribute to projects designed to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Issues in the Elytron issue tracker were triaged ahead of the event and new contributors were onboarded and taught about Git, creating and submitting pull requests, and how Open Source works.
The event went well for the Elytron team with double the amount of PRs submitted than in the Summer Open Source Day!</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 23 September 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to yet another installment of the JBoss Editorial! September is coming to an end, but it has been a pretty busy month for the JBoss community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus">Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quarkus has really come a long way since the first release only a few years ago. A testament to the fact is certainly the compelling user stories released by the project’s team in the last weeks. First, we have <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/logicdrop-customer-story/">How Quarkus Improved Logicdrop’s Developer Experience and Process</a>, followed by <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/adoptium-customer-story/">Eclipse Adoptium Uses Quarkus for high volume Java SE distribution API</a>. And we even have a nice retail business use case, with <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/decathlon-user-story/">VCStream: a new messaging platform for DECATHLON’s Value Chain, built on Quarkus</a>!</p>
<p>So, if you have yet to jump onboard the Quarkus train, it’s really time to do so! And, to help you do it, you can check out this nice tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/20/quarkus-spring-developers-getting-started">Quarkus for Spring developers: Getting started</a>.

<h2 id="_decaf_ansible_for_jboss_middleware">Decaf' - Ansible for JBoss middleware</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>In the past months, we’ve been doing some hard work to ensure that JBoss software can fit as neatly as possible within an Ansible playbook. There is a still a lot to be done, but we are already quite proud of to two Ansible collections we have released. The first one is called, JCliff, but will soon be renamed to WildFly, as it aims to integrate, as smoothly as possible, the app server into Ansible. The latest version (v.0.0.10) has already a few exciting features:
* systemd integration, a reusable role to help set up WildFly as a systemd service
* a reusable role to install JDBC driver and their module
* and, of course, more fine-tuning of WildFly’s subsystem thanks to the JCLiff (embedded in the collection) which allows Ansible to configure mod_cluster, sockets, JMS queues and so many other features.</p>
<p>We are also very happy about the release of JWS Collection for Ansible (v0.0.2), which allows us to quickly set up Apache Tomcat or its counterpart, JBoss Web Server, but also provides some nice features, like integration with systemd and common criteria (partial) compliance checking. Please check our blog entry about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/08/30/automate-red-hat-jboss-web-server-deployments-ansible">Ansible collection for Apache Tomcat / JWS</a> for more details!</p>
<p>(Given that those are projects I work on, I fully assume that this entry is a shameless plug :) )</p>
<p><em>That’s all for today! Please join us again in two weeks for another installment of our JBoss editorial! Stay safe and healthy in the meantime.</em></p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>After short pause for the summer holiday, welcome back to this new installment of the JBoss Editorial! As always, the JBoss community has been quite active and there is quite a lot to cover today, especially on hybrid cloud and Kogito. Let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_hybrid_cloud">Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>During the last weeks, Christina Lei did a quite interesting series of articles on hybrid cloud. After an <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/overview-of-making-hybrid-multi-cloud.html">overview of making hybrid cloud</a>, she explores some in-depth topic like <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/hybrid-multi-cloud-dynamic-security.html">dynamic security</a> or <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/observability-in-hybrid-multi-cloud">observability</a>.

<p>With the new release of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-1-9-1-released.html">Kogito 1.9.1</a>, it’s time to explore (maybe again) all the potential of this framework. And fortunately, there are a lot of in-depth articles released recently doing just that! Let’s start with one on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-to-capture-business-decisions-using-dmn-introduction-to-some-basic-patterns-and-their-value.html">how to capture decisions using DMN</a> followed by a tutorial on how to implement <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-task-deadlines.html">task’s deadline</a> with Kogito.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, you’ll want to learn how to manage your <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/four-steps-to-author-bpmn-and-dmn-assets-on-gitpod-io.html">BPMN and DMN assets on gitpod.io</a>. Or explore <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/event-driven-decisioning-with-amq-streams-and-kogito.html">event-driven decisinning with AMQ streams and Kogito</a>. If those articles have but open your appetite for the framework, you can carry on with a tutorial on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-develop-better-widgets-with-showcase-appl.html">how to develop better widgets</a> or how to <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/add-data-from-kie-execution-server-for-authoring-dashboards.html">add data from KIE server for authoring dashboards</a>.</p>

<p>Karina Varela has a post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/24/automating-rule-based-services-java-and-kogito">automating rule-based services with Java and Kogito</a> up on the Red Hat Developer Blog. The post focuses on Kogito and using it to build, package, and automate the deployment of those rule-based services on Kubernetes and OpenShift!</p>
<p>James Falkner quickly tackles <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/07/01/resteasy-reactive-and-more-quarkus-20">RESTEasy Reactive in Quarkus 2.0</a> over on the Red Hat Developer Blog. With the release of Quarkus 2.0 there are a number of things that have improved. Using REST in a reactive way is one of them. Quarkus 2.0 utilizes Eclipse Vert.x 4 and does some optimizations at build time to further increase performance of REST services.</p>
<p>If you’re using Red Hat 3scale API Management and have a need to use WebSockets, be sure to check out Srikanth Kalluru’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/07/01/how-expose-websocket-endpoint-using-red-hat-3scale-api-management">blog post</a> for a quick three step walk through of how to get it done!</p>
<p>Mauro Vocale has a three part series, part four is not out yet, about moving Java programs to the cloud. <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/25/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-1-incremental-approach-using-jakarta-ee">Part one</a> introduces you to the legacy application and gets it up and running on OpenShift. This gets you familiar with what the application does and what to expect from further refactorings in subsequent posts. In <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/28/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-2-upgrade-legacy-java-application-jakarta">part two</a> the application will move from Java 8 to Java 11, JBoss EAP 7.3 and Jakarta EE. Lastly, in <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/30/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-3-integrate-microprofile-services">part three</a> the application will be moved to microservices. Additional monitoring tools will be introduced including Prometheus and Jaeger. The application will be updated for handling restarts, health checks, and other configuration settings.</p>
<p>Over in the BPM arena, there are three posts to take a look at: <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/custom-logic-in-bpmn.html">Custom logic in BPMN</a> by Kirill Gaevksii, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/07/how-to-start-contributing-to-drools-executable-model.html">How to start contributing to Drools executable model</a> where Luca Molteni discusses getting your feet with contributing to Drools’s "Executable Model Compiler". Lastly, Matteo Mortari discusses <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/intelligent-kafka-message-routing-using-drools-dmn-engine-and-apache-camel.html">using Drools DMN and Apache Camel to intelligently route Kafka messages</a>. It includes a video as well as various examples and code to really sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Wildfly 24.0.0.Final includes a preview of Jakarta EE 9.1 features. Jeff Mesnil discusses <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/07/01/wildfly-preview-bootable-jar/">how to try these features out using a bootable jar</a>.

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Katia and Ryan on the Infinispan team released a nice two-part series of posts that explained how they built an online game across data centers and multiple cloud providers for this year’s Summit keynote demonstration.
In the first part, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">Building a real-time leaderboard with Infinispan and Quarkus on a hybrid Kubernetes deployment</a>, Katia and Ryan describe how they designed and implemented various services using Infinispan and Quarkus.
With part two, they explain how using the Infinispan Operator greatly reduced the complexity of standing up their clusters, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/08/create-and-manage-red-hat-data-grid-services-hybrid-cloud">Creating and managing Infinispan services in the hybrid cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Tommaso Teofili’s recent post, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/autotuning-lime-explanations-with-few-predictions.html">Autotuning LIME explanations with few predictions</a>, outlines how to automatically tune LIME hyperparameters to achieve more stable explanations and comes with a PR that lets you dig into all the technical aspects covered in the post.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/rhpam-connectivity-to-external-amq-configurations-in-openshift.html">RHPAM connectivity to external AMQ configurations in OpenShift</a> by Michael Perez takes an in-depth look at connecting to an external AMQ with the aim of lowering the memory footprint for RHPAM pods as well as other deployment optimizations.
It’s an interesting read with good technical considerations to sink your teeth into so go give it a look.</p>
<p>Over on the WildFly blog, Jeff Mesnil walks us through the process of changing logging levels for cloud-based WildFly applications on the fly.
Take a look at Jeff’s script and straightforward commands to help you easily modify logs for debugging in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/06/15/change-log-level-wildfly-cloud/">How to Change Logging Level for WildFly on the Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam is back with a post on the Red Hat Developer blog titled <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/14/application-modernization-patterns-apache-kafka-debezium-and-kubernetes">Application modernization patterns with Apache Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes</a>.
I really enjoyed this one as Bilgin expertly puts application modernization in context and examines different patterns, tools, and open-source ecosystems that can help you migrate brown-field systems to more modern, event-driven services as well as design green-field services that are future proof by providing the ability to evolve over time.
Be sure to catch up on this one if you haven’t already read it.</p>
<p>Just in time for your summer reading list the first book dedicated to Keycloak has been published, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2021/06/book.adoc">Keycloak - Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications</a>.
Congrats to authors Stian Thorgersen and Pedro Igor Silva.
It’s an impressive achievement and no doubt the book is full of invaluable expertise.</p>

<p>In our last editorial we mentioned Eric Schabell’s series on a retail data framework.
Since then Eric has obviously been hard at work as his next two posts in the series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-common-architectural-elements.html">Retail data framework - Common architectural elements</a> and <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/06/retail-data-framework-example-data-architecture.html">Retail data framework - Example data architecture</a>.
If you haven’t caught up on that series yet, then I highly recommend taking a look to learn about data flows and management in a retail context.</p>
<p>Eric has also posted the first in his next series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/cloud-adoption-an-architectural-introduction.html">Cloud adoption - An architectural introduction</a>.
This series is focused on proven integrations, structures, and interactions with the goal of enabling readers to implement and adopt cloud-based solutions using open-source technologies.
I’m really excited about this series and can’t wait to see what Eric brings in his next posts.</p>

<p>To our community and all our readers,</p>
<p>I’d like to start this edition with a sincere and frank apology on behalf of the editorial team for the posts we missed in the last month.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of awesome content that our community has shared and multiple project releases packed with useful new features and clever enhancements.
We’re long overdue in highlighting and celebrating all the great work that JBoss teams are doing, not to mention all the brilliant work of our evangelists and other contributors.</p>
<p>It’s been a busy past few weeks and we’ve got a lot of great articles and releases to catch up on, so let’s go.</p>

<p>With the recent release of Quarkus CR2, I’m sure we’re all anticipating Quarkus 2.0 GA.
As part of that release, Max and the rest of the Quarkus team are taking questions that they will answer on an episode of Quarkus Insights.
Use the <code>#quarkusinsights</code> tag to submit a question via social media and tune in to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETTMBWEBfLY">Quarkus Insights #51: Q &amp; A - Part II</a> on June 2 to hear your questions answered.</p>

<p>Jeff Mesnil has authored a very helpful and detailed look at building and deploying WildFly applications on OpenShift using Helm Charts in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/05/05/helm-charts-for-wildfly/">Helm Chart for WildFly</a></p>
<p>Over on the Infinispan blog, Ryan Emerson has shared some details about the CLI compiled to a native image in <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/05/21/infinispan-cli-image">Infinispan Native CLI</a>, which is well worth a read.
You should also try downloading the latest Infinispan 12 server version and taking it for a spin with the native CLI!</p>
<p>Another recent one from the Infinispan team comes from Katia Aresti who, along with Ryan Emerson, explains how they <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">built a real-time leaderboard using Data Grid and several Quarkus extensions</a> to add some magic to this year’s Red Hat Summit Keynote.</p>
<p>Jacopo Rota on the Kogito blog explains how to <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/05/getting-started-with-trustyai-in-only-15-minutes.html">how to deploy a Kogito service together with the TrustyAI infrastructure on an OpenShift cluster in only 15 minutes</a>!</p>
<p>Have you been wanting to find out more about Shenandoah GC? Well, you should dive right in and check out Roman Kennke’s informative post, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/20/shenandoah-garbage-collection-openjdk-16-concurrent-reference-processing">Shenandoah garbage collection in OpenJDK 16: Concurrent reference processing</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam has recently posted <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2021/05/data-gateways-of-future.html">Data Gateways in the Cloud Native Era</a> that examines how data gateway components support different use cases and offer a solution for hybrid workloads spread across multiple cloud providers.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least is Claus Ibsen’s webinar, <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/05/webinar-integrate-systems-in-age-of.html">Integrate systems in the age of Quarkus and Camel</a>, that explores how the trio of Camel Quarkus, Camel K, and Kamelets simplify the work to manage and bind systems together.</p>

<p>Eric Schabell never disappoints and his previous series on architectural elements in a real-time stock control solution for retail was no exception.
Eric rounds that series off nicely with <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/real-time-stock-control-example-stock-control-architecture.html">Real-time stock control - Example stock control architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Not one to rest for long, Eric Schabell launches a new series that tackles how to create a framework for accessing retail data from customers, stock, stores, and staff across multiple internal teams.
I’m sure it’s going to be a brilliant series so go have a look for yourself and find out more in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-architectural-introduction.html">Retail data framework - An architectural introduction</a>.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed reading through Christina and Eric’s <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/05/tooling-guide-for-getting-started-with.html">Tooling guide for Getting Started with Apache Camel in 2021</a>.
It’s a well put together beginner’s guide to tools that can help with Camel applications.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 26 April 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another - slightly delayed, installment of our JBoss Editorial! If anything, the last two weeks in the Jboss community has been all about Quarkus and Kogito. Indeed, you’ll find in this post a trove of information and news on the two projects. But also, an exciting opportunity on Keycloak! Without any further ado, let’s jump right in.</p><p></p>

<p>With the Red Hat Summit coming up tomorrow, you may want to check out this post of our very own Eric D. Schabell on the new format we are trying out this year: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/red-hat-summit-2021-how-to-enjoy-this-three-part-event-series.html">Red Hat Summit: How to enjoy this three-part event series</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, Eric has, as always, delivered a steady stream of content in the past weeks, with a focus on headless architecture. It started with a first post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, to which he did a followup on: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.</p>
<p>Headless architecture was also part of the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-architectural-introduction.html">Store health and safety architectural introduction</a>, which also was followed up by a post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-common-architectural-elements.html">Store health and safety common architectural elements</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As mentioned in our introduction, Quarkus has been the focused on many content released in the last weeks. On top of that, as you’ll see in the releases section of this editorial, the project has released not one, but two versions, including an alpha of the upcoming Quarkus 2.0.</p>
<p>Let’s first take a look at the content relating to Quarkus as a development platform. If you are still new to Quarkus, you may want to start then with this post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/07/deploy-quarkus-everywhere-with-red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel/">deploying Quarkus everywhere with RHEL</a>. After that, still on the topic of packaging and deployment, you can learn how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/08/build-even-faster-quarkus-applications-with-fast-jar/">build even faster Quarkus applications with Fast jar</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already onboard Quarkus and his very neat development model, you’ll be quite happy to learn that <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/14/mandrel-a-specialized-distribution-of-graalvm-for-quarkus/">Mandrel, a specialized distribution of GraalVM for Quarkus</a> is coming up!</p>
<p>As you may be aware, Quarkus comes already with quite a few supported extensions, but you may still want to learn more about <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/solving-problems-with-custom-extensions/">custom extensions and which problems they can help you solve</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already running or developing a few webapps on Quarkus, you’ll be interested in <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/gui-react-patternfly/">learning how to add eye candy to it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Let’s take a look at what’s been happening in the community since our last editorial.</p>
<p>First up is a post by Hao Wu, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/how-to-interact-with-business-processes-using-camel-routes.html">How to Interact with Business Processes Using Camel Routes</a>, that neatly explains using Apache Camel to interact with business processes deployed in a KIE server.</p>
<p>Rebecca Searls, over at the RESTEasy blog, recently added a post titled <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2021/04/05/blog-ParamConverter-with-Quarkus/">JAX-RS ParamConverter with Quarkus</a> that shows how to write RESTful services with Quarkus using the JAX-RS ParamConverter.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell has, yet again, delivered some great posts recently that demonstrate how community technology can solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Finishing off a series of articles on point of sale architectures, Eric delves in a specific example in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-example-image-distribution-architecture.html">Point of sale - Example image distribution architecture</a>.
Be sure to check the links at the end of the post in case you missed any of the other articles in his architecture blueprint for point of sale imaging in retail.</p>
<p>Not one to rest, Eric kicks things off with another series to share an architectural blueprint for the use case of deploying a container-based eCommerce website while moving away from tightly coupled existing eCommerce platform.</p>
<p>This first article in this series is <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, which gives you an outline for the use case.</p>
<p>Eric then continues the series with his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.
In this article, Eric goes into detail on common generic elements that make up the architecture blueprint for the headless eCommerce use case.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the rest of Eric’s series!
I’m sure there’s lots more great information on the way.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 25 March 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we search through the JBoss Community for interesting articles and updates</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introducing_the_prolific_eric_schabell">Introducing the prolific Eric Schabell</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are a regular reader of the JBoss Editorial  you will be very familiar with the work of Eric Schabell, arguably one of the most prolific writers within the JBoss Community.  This edition is no different and sees Eric product three more articles.</p>
<p>Eric’s first article is a continuation of his Supply Chain Integration Blueprint discussion.  In this article Eric <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-example-store-integration-architecture.html">expands on the common architectural elements discussed previously and outlines an example Store integration architecture for Supply Chain integration</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s second article walks us through <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/codeready-containers-howto-setup-openshift-47-on-local-machine.html">the necessary steps for installing and running the OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 on our local machines</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s final article kicks off a new series of articles within which he will introduce a new architectural blueprint covering <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-an-architectural-introduction.html">"Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support for container based applications"</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_whats_new_in_kogito_land">What’s new in Kogito land?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The <a href="http://kie.org">Kogito team</a> have been busy over the last few weeks publishing a number of interesting blog posts covering different aspects of the Kogito ecosystem.</p>
<p>We begin our coverage with an article written by William <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/building-prometheus-dashboards-in-business-central.html">demonstrating how to integrate metrics from a Prometheus datasource into the Business Central</a>.  The article walks you through the process from the creation of the data set within Dashbuilder, building the dashboard, how to consider filtering requirements and how to test the dashboard.</p>
<p>The next article, written by Manaswini, follows on from William’s article and <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/time-series-component-for-dashbuilder.html">demonstrates how you can further extend your dashboard through the integration and visualisation of time series data</a>.</p>
<p>The final article, written by Ricardo, introduces us to Kogito’s support for the <a href="https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/">CNCF Serverless Workflow</a> specification, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/restful-services-orchestration-with-kogito-and-openapi.html">allowing Kogito to provide a serverless interface to a service which can also be used to orchestrate RESTful services described through the OpenAPI standard</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clustering_wildfly_using_dns_ping">Clustering WildFly using DNS ping</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>When running within a kubernetes environment it is natural to consider the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING protocol</a> for cluster discovery, a protocol relying on the ability to query the kubernetes API server.  If you want to remain agnostic of your environment, or if you do not have sufficient permissions to query the kubernetes API server, then an alternative approach to consider would be the <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">DNS_PING protocol</a> as <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">demonstrated by Yeray using a simple WildFly bootable JAR application</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_optimizing_camel_3_9_no_more_saw_tooth_jvm_garbage_collection">Optimizing Camel 3.9, no more saw tooth JVM garbage collection</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The upcoming Camel 3.9 release will include some additional, significant improvements in the performance of the internal routing engine leading to a dramatic reduction in object allocation during continuous use.  The Camel team focussed on the five major areas of the codebase they had identified during performance testing with the intention of reducing the allocation count as much as possible, they managed to go one better and achieved a sustained object allocation count of zero!  For more information take a look at <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/03/apache-camel-39-no-more-saw-tooth-jvm.html">Claus' blog describing the effort</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_monitoring_quarkus_applications_on_openshift">Monitoring Quarkus applications on OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are running a Quarkus application on OpenShift you will most likely have a need for integrating with the centralised prometheus instance within the cluster.  This integration is fairly straight forward and can be achieved after following only a few simple steps <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/micrometer-prometheus-openshift/">as ably demonstrated by Jose</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>There’s been a lot of activity since the last editorial so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>First up is Ramon Gordillo’s rather interesting take on moving legacy technology on Kubernetes.
Ramon starts by pointing out that even software that is considered "legacy" and traditionally on-prem is often packed with new and useful features.
Add to that the fact that many containerized applications still rely on legacy systems - "not all apps are greenfield" - and he builds a solid case for doing something that might otherwise induce a few gasps.
Go see how Ramon tackles running IBM DB2 in containers, <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2021/03/trying-db2-in-kubernetes-for-developers/">Trying DB2 in Kubernetes for developers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/migrating-jbpm-images-secured-by-ldap-to-elytron.html">Migrating jBPM images secured by LDAP to Elytron</a> by Gonzalo Muñoz Fernández is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
If you’re not familiar with Elytron it is, as Gonzalo explains, Wildfly’s security framework that puts security management and application access into a single subsystem.
In his post, Gonzalo clearly describes and then steps through how to migrate jBPM images from PicketBox, which is a security subsystem based on JAAS login modules, over to Elytron.</p>
<p>Also on the Kogito blog, Paul Brown and Emily Murphy take on the challenge of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/optimizing-covid-19-vaccination-appointment-scheduling.html">Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination appointment scheduling</a>.
Their post details the approach for using OptaPlanner to handle planning constraints and automatically assign vaccination appointments.
Getting vaccinations rolled out globally is a massive logistical and planning challenge so it’s comforting to know our community is providing tooling to get us all back to "normal".</p>
<p>The Red Hat Developer blog has a couple of recent entries focused on JavaScript that are both good reads.</p>
<p>Michael Dawson introduces us to the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/08/introduction-to-the-node-js-reference-architecture-part-1-overview/">Node.js reference architecture from Red Hat and IBM</a> and explains their reasons for creating it.
The goal is to help developers make good choices when navigating the vibrant and extensive JavaScript ecosystem by recommending packages based on shared experience across teams and projects.</p>
<p>Joel Lord takes us through <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/04/building-rootless-containers-for-javascript-front-ends/">Building rootless containers for JavaScript front ends</a> to demonstrate how you can avoid security vulnerabilities and potential disaster.</p>

<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Our ever productive Eric Schabell has brought us some fantastic content that should really get you thinking about community technology can apply to solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Similarly to James and Emily’s post on the Kogito blog, Eric shows how <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/business-optimisation-architecture-example-vaccine-scheduling-.html">retail pharmacies can optimize scheduling to provide customer vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p>Eric also provides a <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-an-architectural-introduction.html">architectural blueprint for supply-chain integration</a> that comes with a treasure trove of resources and is well worth delving into.</p>

<h2 id="_wildfly_23_beta_microprofile">Wildfly 23 Beta: Microprofile</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As the release of the next major version of Wildlfy is coming up soon, Brian Stanberry took the time to write up a brief article on the <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/02/24/WildFly23-Beta-Released/">progress with MicroProfile</a>.

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_kogito">Kogito</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are already a Kogito user or if you are interested in exploring this software, there were a few articles released in the past two weeks that you might find interesting. The first one is on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/kogito-notifications-api.html">Kogito Notification API</a> which is followed nicely by the second one on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/event-driven-decisions-with-kogito.html">Event-driven decisions with Kogito</a></p>
<p>If you want something more practical, you’ll certainly enjoy the third article on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/3-steps-to-author-bpmn-dmn-editors-on-github-codespaces.html">3 steps to author BPMN and DMN assets on GitHub Codespaces</a></p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 11 February 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Here we are again, it’s been two weeks and we’re into the second month of 2021!
How quickly times flies!
In this edition, expect to find release information, blog posts, and general updates from around the JBoss Community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-2-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.2.Final</a> is the second maintenance release for the Quarkus 1.11 branch. The notable bug fix with this version is updating to Hibernate ORM 5.4.27.SP1 which fixes a potential data loss issue. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.2.Final">full changelog for more info</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.3.Final</a> is a quick bug fix release that focused on a regression making it impossible to build native executables if your project was using both RESTEasy and OpenTracing. <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.3.Final">Please see the full changelog</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/02/11/WildFly2201-Released/">Wildfly 22.0.1</a> has been released, about a month after 22.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vertx.io/blog/eclipse-vert-x-4-0-2/">Vert.x 4.0.2 released</a> recently. The 4.0.1 release also happened, but contained potential memory leaks and the team decided not to announce it and proceed with another quick release to fix the issues. <a href="https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.0.2-Release-Notes">Please view the release notes for more details</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/kogito-tooling-0-8-3-released.html">Kogito Tooling 0.8.3 released</a> a few days ago. With the release of 0.8.1, the Kogito team released their official version of the BPMN and DMN standalone editors. This release builds on that and continues to allow you to embed the editor within your application. It also allows you to open DMN 1.1 and 1.3 assets. The post also contains a list of bugs squashed</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_highlights_from_the_blogosphere">Highlights from the blogosphere</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Eric Schabell published a migration guide for a traditional JBoss BPM application running either within a VM or on bare-metal to running inside containers using OpenShift Container Platform.
In <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/4-easy-steps-for-migrating-projects-to-openshift-container-platform.html">his post he breaks the migration down into four steps</a>.
I won’t detail them all here, but the steps are very easy and you should be able to get up and running quickly on your own laptop, even without having some of the tech installed previously!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/improvements-of-project-authoring-in-business-central.html">Abhishek Kumar discussed project authoring improvements within Business Central recently on the KIE Blog</a>.
The features he discusses are:
. Opening projects directly with a URL
. Changing the default asset page size
. Security permissions for project screen tools and tabs</p>
<p>Each of these help users in the authoring process within Business Central through either ease of use or security!</p>
<p>Still on the KIE Blog, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/01/how-to-use-a-pmml-file-in-dmn-editor-vscode.html">Yeser Amer demonstrates how to use PMML models in the DMN Editor</a>.
PMML support was released with version 0.7.0.
PMML is an XML file describing a predictive model often generated by data mining or AI algorithms.
The support for this format within the VSCode plugin was recently released and follows the same usage patterns as those found within Business Central, so it may very well be familiar to some.</p>
<p>A number of blogs about Quarkus sprang up over the past couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Firstly, Georgios Andrianakis discusses <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive-faq/">achieving massive performance without headaches</a> in a RESTEasy application on Quarkus using RESTEasy Reactive.
He talks about the different models, how to use them, the best way to get performance out of each model, and why this will likely becoming the default model within RESTEasy on Quarkus in the near future.</p>
<p>Clement Escoffier <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/getting-started-amqp/">helps us get started with AMQP in Quarkus</a> with an in-depth demo similar to using Kafka.
He walks you through the basics and gives you a running project which he steps through to show you all the basics.</p>
<p>Over on the Red Hat Developers Blog, Eric Deandrea shows us a very cool trick, or maybe the power of Quarkus’s Spring compatibility, about running a Spring Boot application on Quarkus without changing a single line of Java code!
It is definitely worth the read, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/09/spring-boot-on-quarkus-magic-or-madness/">head on over to check it out</a>!</p>
<p>If you missed the announcement about Quarkus remote development, be sure to read up about it by Daniel Oh <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/11/enhancing-the-development-loop-with-quarkus-remote-development/">on the Red Hat Developer Blog</a>.
Using a mutable-jar package, you can deploy onto OpenShift and continue to develop remotely without having to build a new container and push every time you want to see a change!
What an amazing way to build on the cloud and make sure everything works correctly without having slow downs!</p>
<p>Yeray Borges of the Wildfly team <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/02/01/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-openshift/">demonstrates how to deploy a bootable Wildfly application jar which caches the HTTP session state</a>.
It’s a useful option allowing you to build and test locally and then push to OpenShift with minimal changes ensuring your application still works in the cloud.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mario Fusco and Edson Yanaga have a presentation from a recent DevNation Live about designing a Java API.
Check it out over on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/design-java-apis">the Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Certainly worth the watch if you develop APIs in Java (which should be most of you).</p>
<p>Thanks for being with us for another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 28 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Infinispan 12 release, codenamed <code>Lockdown</code>, brings a ton of new features and improvements.
Indexing and querying capabilities have seen a number of improvements with the help of Hibernate Search integration.
ProtoStream marshalling is upgraded with a new <code>@ProtoAdapter</code> annotation that lets you easily integrate third-party classes.
It’s a pretty elegant solution to what could present itself as a real headache for developers.
Speaking of marshalling improvements, Infinispan 12 also makes your life easier by automatically generating and registering <code>SerializationContextInitializer</code> implementations to marshall user types.
Also notable is the SPI for cross-site replication merge conflicts, which continues on the brilliant work that team has done to provide a solution for ensuring data integrity.
There’s a lot going on in Infinispan 12 and probably too much to try and sum up here so why not head over and read all the details in the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/01/25/infinispan-12-final">Infinispan 12.0.0.Final Announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the entire Infinispan team on all the hard work.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-0-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11</a> is here!
This release brings you RESTEasy Reactive, which is a new JAX-RS implementation for writing RESTful services.
Quarkus 1.11 also introduces the Dev UI so you can quickly visualize all your loaded extensions, access docs, and more.
Of course there are other things in Quarkus 1.11 but RESTEasy Reactive and the Dev UI look to be quite promising indeed.</p>
<p>The Quarkus team keep things rolling with the release of <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.3.0/">Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.3.0</a> that adds codestarts to the Quarkus project wizard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2021/01/keycloak-1202-released.html">Keycloak 12.0.2</a> is now available too!

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 14 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to the first installment of our JBoss Editorial for 2021! And to start the year, we have a brand new major release of the core product of the JBoss community! Yes, Wildfly 22 is out!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_22_and_camel_3_7">Wildfly 22 and Camel 3.7</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yes! We have a brand new major version of Wildfly! <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/01/13/WildFly22-Final-Released/">Wildfly 22 is out!</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes support for use of log4j2 in applications, new base health and metrics subsystems to provide server observability for users who don’t need the application instrumentation that comes with MicroProfile Health and Metrics, and a number of other features related to management, provisioning, messaging and security. Plus numerous bug fixes, enhancements and component upgrades.</p>
<p>On top of that, there is also an updated version of the new tech-preview WildFly Preview distribution. This will allow the community have a look at what Wildfly developers are doing for Jakarta EE 9 support, along with other changes in the server architecture that are expected to appear later in 2021.</p>
<p>Wildfly 22 is already a nice treat, but we also have <a href="https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/12/Camel37-Whatsnew/">Camel 3.7</a>, which also quite exciting, and fortunately for all of us, Claus Ibsen has published a review of what he called <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/12/apache-camel-37-lts-released-fastest.html">the fastest Camel ever!</a> So, go check it out if you want to know more about this camel release.</p>

<h2 id="_tech_bytes">Tech bytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>A few interesting technical articles came out in the last weeks, so we’ll try to catch you up with three of them here. First, we have an excellent one from Bela Ban on <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/12/running-jgroups-raft-as-service.html">running JGroups raft as a service</a>. It’s very hands on post, focusing on getting everything running. Then we have a longer walkthrough to let you experiment on <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2020/12/spring-boot-embedded-cache-with-infinispan-in-kubernetes/">using Spring boot embedded cache with Infinispan on Kubernetes</a>. Certainly, worth a look, isn’t it? The last one is, of course, on Quarkus, because Quarkus is, as it should, all the rage lately. In this article, Clément Escoffier took the time to explain some of the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/magic-control">magic beneath Quarkus and Vert.x</a> and why this is the kind magic you to have as a developer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, our very own Eric Schabell has been busy in the few last weeks and released a steady stream of new content. First, he published <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/01/codeready-containers-installing.html">part4 - Installing business automation operator</a> of his series on CodeReady containers. He then revisited the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/12/codeready-containers-exploring-home-loan-mortgage-process.html">Home loan mortgage process using CodeReady Containers</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <article class="" data-tags="Christmas, 2020">
      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 25 December 2020</h1>
      <p>I’m writing this on Christmas Day and have spent the last week or so thinking about what I should put
into my traditional 25th of December entry. Then it came to me in that "lightbulb moment": I’d replicate,
more or less, what I said to my entire team/org before I went on vacation a few days earlier. It’s a summary
of the year and I think it’s relevant for our wider community too. So here it is in a slightly modified form …​</p>
<p>I wanted to spend a few minutes thanking you all for the work and interactions you’ve done over this testing year!
I don’t think anyone could have predicted 2020 at the start of the year and I think it’s fair to say that every one of us
has been affected in one way or another. Yet if you look back on the year and the accomplishments we’ve achieved
as a community, you could be forgiven for thinking this was a normal year!</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making Quarkus available to all OpenShift customers, which we announced at KubeCon, as well as continuing the innovation within
(e.g., Hibernate Reactive, RESTeasy Reactive);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knative/Serverless, where we now have 7 Working Group leads out of 15 in the Knative community, we also added Functions to OpenShift Serverless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more of our technologies become available to Kube developers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued our close involvement with AdoptOpenJDK (aka Eclipse Adoptium), helping to push it to even greater heights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many great innovations continued around efforts such as Kogito, Strimzi, Camel-K, Eclipse Vert.x, Infinispan, …​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all managed to host, attend, present at countless virtual conferences, workshops and Red Hat Summit; probably enough to realise what
we’re all missing from the real things!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eclipse MicroProfile 4.0 and Eclipse Jakarta EE 9.0 both come to life;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The list could go on and on (e.g., EAP XD, OptaPlanner, …) but my point isn’t so much to call out the successes that this
community have helped to drive but rather to illustrate that we were able to do these and more at all! In the
climate of 2020, retaining the kind of focus we have and continuing to go above and beyond, as many of you and the teams
have, is a testament to Red Hat and our communities, our culture and the supporting bonds you’ve all built up and nurtured. For that
alone I thank you and you should all be incredibly proud!</p>
<p>With that in mind, whether or not you celebrate Christmas or intend to take extended time away, make sure you do take time
to rest and recharge. Be with your friends and family as much as you can given the continuing Covid situation. Find time to unwind
but also congratulate yourself on coming together in 2020 and delivering so much to our communities, partners and customers. I’m not
even going to try to predict what 2021 will be like but if we can replicate what we’ve been able to do in 2020, I’m sure
we’ll all come through it stronger and together!</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 17 December 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial and last before the holidays! As always during this period of the year, we all rush to finish our ongoing tasks so that we can enjoy a bit of rest. And the projects of the JBoss community do the same, which means we have quite of lot to discuss today! So, without any further ado…​</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus_and_resteasy_reactive">Quarkus and RestEasy Reactive</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The last months have certainly been quite active for Quarkus. Now part of the portfolio of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus">Red Hat products</a>, the project has everything but slow down. Just last week a new release, <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-10-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.10.3</a> was published, but also RestEasy announced a large refactoring of its project <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive/">RestEasy Reactive</a> in order to integrate and support Quarkus even more. Alessio Soldano, one of the main developers of RestEasy, also shares his thoughts behind this project <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2020/12/07/resteasy-reactive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all in the Quarkiverse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on link:But that’s not all in the Quarkus-verse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on new ways to discover Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/extension-codestarts-a-new-way-to-learn-and-discover-quarkus/"> new ways to discover Quarkus using Extension codestarts</a>. Whether that you already know Quarkus or want to explore it for the first time, this one will be in any case quite interesting to you! Oh, and by the way Quarkiverse is by no means a "bon mot,” it’s the real thing: <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkiverse/">Quarkiverse Hub - Home of Community Extensions</a>, so go check out this article from George Gastaldi to know more about it!</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not the least, another article will help you <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/08/spring-boot-to-quarkus-migrations-and-more-in-red-hats-migration-toolkit-for-applications-5-1-0/">migrating your Spring Boot app to Quarkus using the Red Hat migration toolkit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_apache_avro_and_apicurio_registry">Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Avro and Apicurio got a lot of attention in the last weeks. First, Clément Escoffier, who already took the time to blog about <a href="">How to Use Kafka, Schema Registry and Avro with Quarkus</a> a few months ago, just released a new article on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/avro-native/">Using Avro in a native executable</a>. Hugo Guerrero also took a stab at the topic in his blog entry on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/11/debezium-serialization-with-apache-avro-and-apicurio-registry/">Debezium serialization with Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</a>.</p>

      <h1>This week in JBoss - 20th November 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p><em>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Today, we’ll focus on some core project of our community. The first one is obviously Wildfly, our Jakarta EE application server whom predecessor (JBoss AS) was the beginning of everything. The second one is our more recent and shiny project, Quarkus. Without any further ado, let’s begin!</em></p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_a_first_taste_of_jakarta_9">Wildfly, a first Taste of Jakarta 9</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release of the <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildfly 21.01</a>, it’s time to put the Jakarta EE server back in the spotlight. Especially as this release gives a <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2020/11/12/Jakarta-EE-9-with-WildFly-Preview/">a preview of Jakarta EE 9</a>! And if your knowledge of the EE standards needs a refresher to fully enjoy this preview, we got you covered with this in depth two-part series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">Jakarta EE multitenancy (part1)</a> and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/12/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-2/">(part 2)</a>.</p>
<p>But Jakarta EE 9 is not the only newsworthy item around Wildfly. The first part of my own series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/06/wildfly-server-configuration-with-ansible-collection-for-jcliff-part-1/">automation of Wildfly using Ansible and JCliff</a> is out! It’s hand on a tutorial on how to set up Ansible and its decided collection for Wildfly (<a href="https://github.com/wildfly-extras/ansible_collections_jcliff">JCliff</a>) in order to fully automate the app server set up and configuration.</p>

<h2 id="_quarkus_leading_the_future_of_java">Quarkus, Leading the Future of Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It might a bold statement, but we’ve made it! Or rather Red Hat made it as Quarkus 1.7 is available as a product for a little while now. Maybe it’s time to finally take a look at it by following this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/10/leading-the-future-of-java-with-the-red-hat-build-of-quarkus-1-7/">Red Hat Quarkus tutorial</a>?</p>
<p>This is also a perfect opportunity to explore Quarkus functionality and ecosystems. For instance, take a look at this interesting post on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-invoke-and-call/">mutiny invoke and call</a>. Or simply explore the cloud readiness of the framework with this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/13/how-i-built-a-serverless-blog-search-with-java-quarkus-and-aws-lambda/">building a serverless blog search with Quarkus and AWS lambda</a> and this <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-quarkus-red-hat-openshift?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI">introduction to Quarkus on Red Hat Openshift</a>?</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_techbytes">Techbytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If Quarkus and Wildfly did not quench your thirst for knowledge, let us give you a bit more nuggets. First, why not explore the topic of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/09/openid-connect-integration-with-red-hat-3scale-api-management-and-okta/">using OpenID connect integration with 3scale</a>? Or maybe <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/11/contract-first-development-event-driven.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhFXzh+%28Christina+%E7%9A%84+J%E8%80%81%E9%97%86%29">contract first development using an event-driven approach with Kafka, AMQ Streams, APIcurio</a>? And to make it extra spicy, Christina has even a added a touch of Google protobuf! By the way, if "event driven" is your thing, you can then move this other article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/17/event-driven-serverless-applications-with-camel-k/">event driven serverless with Camel K</a>.</p>
<p>Still hungry for more? Well, maybe it’s time for less crunchy and technical details? What about stepping back and invite some reflection on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/11/open-source-monetization-ecosystem.html">Open Source monetization ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>All this Java made you too jittery? Time for a Java break? Here are a few dry cookies to go along your cup of joe. As mentioned above, the first part of my series on using [Ansible to automate Wildfly setup] might a nice palate cleanser. Also, if you are using Docker you might be interested in this article describing how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/19/transitioning-from-docker-to-podman/">transitioning from Docker to Podman</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30 September 2020</h1>
      <p>It’s that time again where we round up the latest news from the community…</p>
<p>Are you looking to develop projects on your local machine, and push them on to a real OpenShift Container Platform, without having to worry about cloud hosting of your container platform?
In this <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/how-to-setup-openshift-container-platform-45.html">post</a> Eric Schabell provides an easy way to get up and running with CodeReady containers on your own development machine.
He’s automated most of the process through scripts, and guides you through the rest of the process.
Eric also shows you how to drop into the Developer console in OCP providing a developer focused view that hides much of the plumbing that is not needed during development.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/call-an-existing-rest-service-with-apache-camel-k/">post</a> Mary Cochran shows us a simple way to connect existing services together using CamelK via each service’s REST APIs.
Mary gets deep into the details providing code examples and commands to get you up and running.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell continues his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">blog series</a>, bringing you architectural blueprints for&nbsp;cloud-native financial payment services.
The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.
This week he covers the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-common-elements.html">Common Architecture Elements</a> that make up the architecture, and gets into some details with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-immediate-payments-example.html">Immediate Payments Example</a>.</p>
<p>As is normal for this time of year, the conference season is beginning to kick off.
Albeit this year in a virtual arena.
Undoubtedly this is an unfortunate situation for those that enjoy the in-person events.
However, it’s great for accessibility and reach allowing many more people across to globe to attend.
DevConf.US 2020 is one such event.
It’s a free, Red Hat sponsored technology conference for community project and professional contributors to Free and Open Source technologies.
Read more <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/devconfus-2020-appdev-containerization-ask-the-experts.html">here</a> where Eric describes the “AppDev &amp; Containerization Ask the Experts” Panels that he and Kurt Stam  will be moderating.</p>
<p>This week Kapil Shukla explains how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/build-a-data-streaming-pipeline-using-kafka-streams-and-quarkus/">build a data streaming pipeline using Kafka Streams and Quarkus</a>.
In this post Kapil shows how data can be processed in real-time as and when it arrives, instead of being batch processed as was needed in the past.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/22/troubleshooting-user-task-errors-in-red-hat-process-automation-manager-and-red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/">Post</a> Anton Giertli provides help with troubleshooting user task errors in Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.
If you are a developer working with user tasks and having trouble debugging them, this post might well help you out.</p>
<p>With the recent release of Apache Camel VS Code extension (0.0.27) comes several new language support features for Apache Camel.
Read this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/18/new-language-support-features-in-apache-camel-vs-code-extension-0-0-27/">post</a> to learn more.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 16 September 2020</h1>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p>
<p>Our very own Mark Little goes into detail to explain Quarkus and Jakarta EE compatibility. Mark gives an insightful breakdown of the history for both projects and answers a much asked question, will Quarkus and Jarkata EE come together? No spoilers here, though. Go read Mark’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/11/quarkus-and-jakarta-ee-together-or-not/">Quarkus and Jakarta EE: Together, or not?</a> if you already haven’t.</p>
<p>In the evangelist’s corner, Eric Schabell has brought out an excellent <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/beginners-guide-to-decision-management-retail-web-shop.html">hands-on workshop with labs</a> for Red Hat Decision Manager that show you how to design and build a retail web shop from scratch.</p>
<p>Eric also teams up with Ramon Villarreal to bring you architectural blueprints for <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">cloud-native financial payment services</a>. The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.</p>
<p>Leon Matthews continues the topic of all things financial with his analysis of the history of Java in the banking sector and the role Quarkus is playing in allowing banks and financial institutions to embrace change, innovate to remain competitive, and become more efficient. Read Leon’s post: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/25-years-and-going-strong-why-java-matters-future-banks?source=bloglisting">25 years and going strong: Why Java matters to the future of banks</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Quarkus, Clement Escoffier shows you how to build a stream of beer and then retrieve beers in a reactive way. After walking you through how you can do that with Mutiny, Clement provides a gist with all the code that you can compile and execute with jbang and a single command. You can find everything in his <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-pagination/">Handling paginated APIs with Mutiny</a> post.</p>
<p>Another post from the Quarkus team that is worth reading is Jeff Beck’s <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/wipro-customer-story/">Wipro Addresses Seismic Shift in Retail with Quarkus</a>. Jeff shares the Wipro story by describing their needs and challenges and how they adopted Quarkus to modernize their applications and address customer use cases.</p>
<p>If it hasn’t crossed your radar, Bela Ban shows us his plans for a <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/09/one-size-fits-all-jgroups.html">One Size Fits All JGroups</a> program and explains what is needed to get there.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team shares a post that looks at using the <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/01/enforce-custom-resource-policies-with-opa-gatekeeper/">Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper project to enforce policies when creating custom resources</a> and demonstrates how this is useful. While the post focuses on Strimzi, Jakub points out how Gatekeeper can be used with other projects so go take a look.</p>
<p>Releases!!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Infinispan team for releasing the Dev03 cut of Infinispan 12. Cross-site replication capabilities continue to advance with an SPI that includes configurable policies for merging conflicting values from asynchronous backups, a feature which guarantees data consistency between global Infinispan clusters. That’s no small feat of engineering! Find out about that and more over on the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/09/08/infinispan-12/">Infinispan blog</a>.</p>
<p>Quarkus 1.8 is out with some shiny new features, including jbang integration for easy Quarkus-based scripting, support for multiple persistence units for the Hibernate ORM extension, a new Micrometer extension, and update to GraalVM 20.2 for building native apps from Quarkus projects. Here is the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-8-0-final-released/">announcement with all the info</a>.</p>
<p>Keycloak have announced their new Account Console, built on React and PatternFly 4. The latest version offers a fresher look and feel with custom themes and extensions. Go <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2020/09/new-account-console.adoc">check it out</a>.</p>

      <h1>JBoss Weekly Editorial 27 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial!
Summer is drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Red Hat has been resting, or that nothing has been happening over the past two weeks.
There’s been some great movement and progress made, which we’ll cover.
In this edition we’re going to focus on OpenShift, the blogosphere, and finally, other project news.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_openshift">OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Last week was KubeCon Europe 2020, which as you can guess, was a big event for OpenShift!
We had 15 speakers from Red Hat speaking over the three days, giving 17 talks.
A number of new announcements, blog posts, and articles came out during KubeCon Europe 2020, They’re all liked at <a href="https://www.openshift.com/kubecon">the OpenShift event page</a>.
There’s simply too many to link here.
The above event page has videos, press release links, links to other announcements and blogs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Continuing the trend about OpenShift, Paul Vergilis wrote about external clients and Red Hat AMQ over at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/26/connecting-external-clients-to-red-hat-amq-broker-on-red-hat-openshift/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
If you’re interested in getting started with Strimzi, Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, you’ll want to catch up on the blog post Paolo Patierno and Jakub Scholz wrote: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/14/introduction-to-strimzi-apache-kafka-on-kubernetes-kubecon-europe-2020/">Introduction to Strimzi: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes (KubeCon Europe 2020)</a>.
For those of you running OpenJDK 8, you’ll want to know more about JDK Flight Recorder available in OpenJDK 8u262. An indepth intro is available at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/25/get-started-with-jdk-flight-recorder-in-openjdk-8u/">Red Hat Developer Blog</a> written by Mario Torre.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_projects">Projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>To wrap up this edition, we will be looking at two announcements from Keycloak:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/08/keycloak-1101-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.1 released</a> - fixing seven bugs</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 13 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_5">JGroups 5!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Exciting news from Bela Ban as <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/08/jgroups-500final-released.html">JGroups 5.0.0.Final</a> is released. JGroups 5 brings lots of improvements and some major API changes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Message"><code>Message</code></a> is now an interface with a number of subclasses that perform late marshalling so object payload is serialized at the point when messages are sent, which eliminates a memory allocation and makes JGroups performance even better.</p>
<p>Other cool features in JGroups 5 are <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">virtual thread support</a>, an implementation of the Random Early Drop (RED) protocol, more efficient FD_ALL3 failure detection, a new protocol to dump stats, and lots more.</p>
<p>Hearty congratulations to Bela and all the contributors and folks who made it happen!!</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html">JGroups 5 documentation</a> and find out more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keycloak_tech_talk">Keycloak Tech Talk</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Stian Thorgersen of the Keycloak team presents a DevNation Tech Talk that provides an in-depth look at the best open-source identity and management solution around. Stian gives a great demo of Keycloak that not only highlights features but showcases just how easy it is to integrate and use Keycloak capabilities to secure your applications.</p>
<p>Spend half an hour and let Stian dazzle you with <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/a-deep-dive-into-keycloak/">A deep dive into Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reactive_quarkus_a_java_mutiny">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Another Tech Talk that you should definitely check out comes from Clement Escoffier and Edson Yanaga, who go into detail about Mutiny, a new reactive programming library. Clement and Edson explain why reactive matters, how Mutiny is makes it easier to develop reactive applications, and how the library is integrated with Quarkus.</p>
<p>Listen to Clement and Edson deliver their excellent talk, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/reactive-quarkus-a-java-mutiny/">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_skupper_and_the_hybrid_cloud">Skupper and the Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>By now I’m sure you’ve heard of <a href="https://skupper.io/">Skupper</a> but maybe have yet to see it in action. Ted Ross gives a great introduction and live demonstration of Skupper across AWS, GCP, and Azure that shows real-time load balancing and fail-over.</p>
<p>Watch Ted’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/10/kubernetes-and-the-hybrid-cloud-with-skupper/">Kubernetes and the hybrid cloud with Skupper</a> Tech Talk today. You won’t regret it.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_in_the_community">In the Community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Katia Aresti has created a pretty awesome Infinispan Server tutorial that demonstrates a full set of capabilities with a weather application. Visit the <a href="https://infinispan.org/infinispan-server-tutorial/">Infinispan Remote Weather App Tutorial</a> and try it for yourself.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team has written a comprehensive blog post, <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/08/05/using-open-policy-agent-with-strimzi-and-apache-kafka/">Using Open Policy Agent with Strimzi and Apache Kafka</a>, that explores support for Kafka authorization using Open Policy Agent.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! The last two weeks have been pretty rich on published content and releases, so let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_spring_boot_to_quarkus">From Spring Boot to Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As Quarkus community is increasing the question of how to migrate to this new framework (or rather runtime) often arises. If you happen to have such predicament with Spring Boot, I’m sure you’ll be quite interested to read this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/17/migrating-spring-boot-tests-to-quarkus/">migrating Spring Boot tests to Quarkus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_secure_vue_js_with_keycloak">Secure vue.js with Keycloak</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If most of the content we mentioned today is made of articles, we have one, quite cool video content to share. It’s coming straight from one of the tech-talks of the DevNation and we hope you’ll like it :  <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/secure-vuejs-keycloak">Secure vue.js using Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_double_your_performance_with_virtual_threads">JGroups: Double your performance with virtual threads!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quite a lot of exciting things are happening in the realm of JGroups lately! Last time, we already mentioned the <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a>, but Bela Ban, the creator of project, got us even more excited with this news about <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">how one can double its performance using virtual threads (fibers) on JDK15/16</a>!!! This JDK is still a bit down the road, but its certainly a nice glimpse into tomorrow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_back_to_the_basics">Back to the Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As said above, the last two weeks have been particularly rich in interesting content around the JBoss community and the Java ecosystem at large. Some of those articles took the time to go back and rethink some aspects of our work that we take for granted. Let’s first mention this original take on java programming that focuses on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/09/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-tame-inconsistent-state-in-your-java-code/">taming inconsistent state in a Java code</a>.</p>
<p>This first article is already pretty centered around coding, but this next one goes into the very guts of Infinispan! If you know the project, I’m sure you’ll find this entry on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/22/anchored-keys/">anchored keys</a> as fascinating as I did!</p>
<p>Let’s also revisit a classic: load balancing a JEE app server (such as Wildfly or its product counterpart JBoss EAP), but with a twist: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/15/load-balancing-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-subclusters-with-mod_cluster/">Load balancing Red Hat JBoss EAP with subclusters</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>No rest for the wicked! And no, no rest for our very own Eric D. Schabell! In the last two weeks, he has been quite busy again. First of all, he got his very <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/what-the-dev-podcast-episode-44-agile-integration.html">first interview on a podcast</a> (yep, that’s right, he was never on a podcast before!). With the host, he discussed the best practices for Agile integration. If you are interested in this topic, fetch the episode, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>That’s not all. Eric also took the time to update and release his "fully updated to the latest release" version of his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/beginners-guide-building-a-retail-web-shop-workshop-update.html">Beginners guide - Building a retail web shop workshop update</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, he took the time to describe <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/how-to-install-rhpam-77.html">how to How to Install Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7</a> and share his experience with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/shift-remote-2020-devops-heroes.html">Shift Remote 2020 online conference</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_releases_releases_releases">Releases, releases, releases,…​</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, the JBoss community has been pretty busy in the last weeks and a few projects have seized the relative quietness of Summer to release new version of their product:</p>

<h2 id="_decaf">Decaf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>For once, this section stays rather close to Java, covering how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/27/deploy-your-java-web-application-into-the-cloud-using-eclipse-jkube/">deploy your Java Webapp into the cloud using Eclipse JKube</a>.

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 9 July 2020: Over the (j)cliff!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Summer has begun, well, at least for those of you readers living in the northern hemisphere :)! So let’s enjoy it by giving some nice, interesting and exciting reading material to enjoy while resting in the sun (with your mask, #staysafe!).</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_infinispan_11">Infinispan 11!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s out! The new major version of Infinispan is here! Please go and check out <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/03/infinispan-11/">Infinispan 11</a>!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_new_netty_transport">JGroups: new Netty transport!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’ve said it many times, JGroups is an incredible piece of software. The power and the flexibility of the frameworks always dazzle me, so I’m very excited about this <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a> getting into it!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ansible_collection_for_jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s a pet project of mine that I have already mentioned a few months ago: Andrew Block, Roel Holzmans and I have been working on integrating further Widlfy (and EAP) into Ansible, in order to ensure that one can use the tool to fine-tune as much as possible the JEE server’s configuration. We leverage an existing Open Source Java tool called <a href="https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff">JCliff</a> to just that.</p>
<p>Last year, we released a role, already available in <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff">Ansible Galaxy</a>, to integrate JCliff into Ansible. However, since then, the Ansible community released a new format to distribute extension, called Ansible Collection. We therefore decide to migrate our content there and we finally released, just this week, a very first version: <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat/jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p>So, please check it out! All you need to do is $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jcliff:0.0.1 and, voilà, the collection is installed and you can start to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/ansible_collections_jcliff_demo">play with it</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot! This release also supports, on tops of Linux, MacOSX with homebrew! (Windows using Chocolatey is coming next).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_serverless_and_microservice">Serverless and Microservice</h2>

<p>As alluring as “serverless” is, it does, like any other technology, come with its own challenges.

Well, as you’ll see Ansible, while being Python, plays well with Java software, as demonstrated by this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/03/automate-workshop-setup-with-ansible-playbooks-and-codeready-workspaces/">automate workshop setup with Ansible playbooks and CodeReady workspaces</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 26 June 2020</h1>
      <p>Here we are, once again at the close of June.
Another summer has begun, albeit a little different than most.
I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and doing well.
There have been some very interesting blogs posted in the past couple of weeks that we’ll discuss in this edition, as well as a few releases.</p>
<p>Operators in Kubernetes provide an extension point for the platform.
They follow a pattern allowing you to manage resources and applications within the cluster.
An operator can be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped.
Did you know, however, that you can convert between the two?
That is exactly what Abhishek Koserwal details in six steps over on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/26/migrating-a-namespace-scoped-operator-to-a-cluster-scoped-operator/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Abhishek walks you through a basic example and provides the full example as a GitHub repo.
Read the article for more information, and reasons why you may want or need to switch between the different scopes.</p>
<p>Multitenancy may be something you deal with everyday, or it may be something you’re looking at adding to your current application base.
Either way, dealing with persistence can be tricky.
Tenants must not see each other’s data, but be allowed to operate simultaneously.
Your application must also perform well while still being easy to maintain.
Rhuan Rocha has started a two part series on how to use JPA with Multitenancy over on the Red Hat Developer blog.
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">The first entry</a> details the problem and presents a possible solution using WildFly and EJBs.
Expect the next installment to look more at Hibernate and JPA solutions.</p>
<p>Effortlessly building a native application is of course, one of the amazing capabilities of Quarkus.
However, when it comes to debugging, a native Quarkus application makes debugging <strong>very</strong> difficult.
A large part of this is the optimizations that happen to create that quick, small, native binary.
This debugging complication hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Andrew Dinn has been working on this problem.
He contributed a solution where the debug information is embedded with in the native image and can be access with <code>gdb</code>.
If you’d like to learn more about the solution, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/debugging-graalvm-native-images-using-gdb/">read Andrew’s blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Quarkus theme, Durgesh Anaokar wrote about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/19/develop-and-test-a-quarkus-client-on-red-hat-codeready-containers-with-red-hat-data-grid-8-0/">developing and testing a Quarkus Red Hat Data Grid client using Red Hat CodeReady Containers</a>.
Durgesh details installing CRC (Red Hat Code Ready Containers) and Data Grid on OpenShift 4 as well as running the client.
Naturally, his project code is hosted in GitHub, you’ll find that link in his blog entry.</p>
<p>Red Hat now has images, Universal Base Images to be exact, of OpenJDK (8 and 11) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.
A Universal Base Image (UBI) is an OCI-compliant container base OS image with runtime and language support that can be used as the base for Docker images and Podman/Buildah images.
These will allow you to deploy and build supportable applications on Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL.
It also includes a number of additional user-space packages over a base UBI.
Read more about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/introducing-the-red-hat-build-of-the-openjdk-universal-base-images-now-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-2/">over at Red Hat Developers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following, you’ll know the Infinispan team has been hard at work on Infinispan 11.
They are proud to announce that <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/15/infinispan-11/">Inifinspan 11.0.0. Final has been released</a>!
A number of improvements and features have been added to this release including clustering, CLI, Hot Rod Client improvements, non-blocking internals, and others.</p>
<p>Along with that new Infinispan release, you can now deploy a <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/16/native-server-announce/">natively compiled version of the Infinispan server</a>!
The memory footprint is only 286MB.
There are also native Quarkus extensions for your Quarkus based applications.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the cloud native party, Apache Camel is <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/18/camel-k-1-0-the-serverless-integration-platform-goes-ga/">announcing the GA release of Apache Camel K 1.0</a>.
This release includes tooling, connectors, and integrations with Knative.
This is a great step forward for doing integrations with a small footprint.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/17/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-released/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0</a> was recently released.
This is a patch that adds MicroProfile capabilities to JBoss EAP.
There are some policy changes you will need to be aware of, but you find links to all of thosewithin the announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being with us on another JBoss Editorial!</p>

<h2 id="_2020_04_30_the_virtual_red_hat_summit_week">[2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’m writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit.
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100%
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to
accommodate many more timezones.</p>
<p>Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that
went beyond the talk format. For examples see
<em>Ask the experts</em>, <em>Networking social hour</em>, and
the <em>Virtual Open Neighborhood</em> on the
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to attend, or want to catch some of the
talks you missed, you can <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/QReg.htm?ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74">re-live the virtual event here</a>.</p>

== Usage That Does Not Require Permission

Below are some guidelines for use of the Project Trademarks where, as long as you are in compliance with the guidelines, no permission is necessary. In all cases, use is permitted only provided that:

* the use is only in connection with promoting the projects
* the use is not disparaging to Red Hat, its products or the projects
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the project
* Proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Project Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as explained in Proper Trademark Use
 

=== Noncommercial and community web sites

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to show support for projects by:

* placing the Project Trademarks on a personal web site or blog to support a project
* making a page on a social networking web site to support a project
* linking to a project from a wiki to provide information or show support for a project
 
The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section.

It is permissible to use the Project Trademarks on websites to show your support for a project, provided that:

* where possible, the design logo hyperlinks to the project website, e.g. http://quarkus.io, or if that is not possible, the site includes a prominent link to the project website.
* the site indicates clearly that it is not affiliated with or endorsed by the project; in addition, where possible:
 - the site must include the text "This site is not affiliated with or endorsed by <project/s>" prominently on any page that includes the Project Trademarks, and
 - if the Project Trademarks appear in a page header or any area that is designed to be presented on more than one page, the notice must also be designed to be presented on all of those pages as well. (i.e. if the Project Trademarks appear in a site-wide header, the informational text must appear in that header or an identically site-wide footer.)
* the site does not use visual styling that could be confusing to viewers or visitors as to whether the site is hosted by or on behalf of a project

=== Business web sites

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to show support for a project by:

* offering Project Merchandise for sale at a retail business or web site
* displaying a link to a project using the Project Trademarks from a business web site
* displaying the Project Trademarks as part of a business that provides services for clients using a project

The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section.

It is permissible to use the Project Trademarks on business web sites, provided that:

* the web site has non-project primary branding
* the design logo hyperlinks to the project website, e.g. http://quarkus.io
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the project
* the use of the Project Trademarks does not imply an association with or endorsement of any non-project goods or services
* the site does not use visual styling that could be confusing to viewers or visitors as to whether the site is hosted by or on behalf of the project

Provided these guidelines are observed, it is permissible to use the Project Trademarks to sell Project Merchandise, and to advertise services for project-based systems (installation, configuration, troubleshooting, etc.)

=== Promotional events

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use the Project Trademarks to promote open source software events such as Oracle Code One or community open source software trade shows. The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section.

It is permissible to use the Project Trademarks without prior permission to promote open source software events where individuals in the project appear as Project Ambassadors or otherwise represent the project, provided the general guidelines above are followed. If you would like to make some non-software goods to give away at the event and don't already have a license to do so, see the 'Non-software goods' section below.

=== Publications

It is permissible to use the Project Trademarks in the title and content of a publication, provided that:

* the use is clearly in reference to the project or its software
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the project
* proper trademark symbols are used in connection with the Project Trademarks and the trademark attribution statement must appear as explained in 'Proper Trademark Use' below.

=== Application themes, skins, and personas

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to show support for a project by placing the Project Trademarks in a theme, persona, or skin intended to alter the appearance of an application. The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section. These guidelines do not apply to the appearance of a web site, which is covered elsewhere in this document.

It is permissible to use the Project Trademarks in themes, personas, or skins for applications to show your support for a project, provided that:

* the use of the Project Trademarks does not conflict with the license or terms of use of the application being altered;
* the use is non-commercial in nature; and,
* the use does not imply sponsorship or endorsement by Red Hat or the project.

If you wish to use any existing project designs other than the Project Trademarks for your work, please observe the licensing requirements for those materials.

== Usage That Requires Permission

Community members must obtain permission prior to using any of the Project Trademarks in the following situations.

=== Domain names

To establish a domain with a project name in its domain name, you must have a http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Trademark_license_agreement[trademark license agreement] with Red Hat.

=== Non-software goods

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use Project Trademarks on non-software goods such as T-shirts, stickers, and pens.

Community members may request from Red Hat a license to use the Project Trademarks on non-software related goods, services, or other entities. Red Hat, or someone it delegates for the task, will ask to see the proposed designs before approving their use.

== Unapproved Use

The following uses of the Project Trademarks are not approved under any foreseeable circumstances.

* Violations of the 'Trademark Usage Guidelines' below.
* Any use outside these guidelines not by explicit written permission

Except as set forth herein, the trademark owner (Red Hat) retains and reserves all rights to the Project Trademarks and their use, including the right to modify these guidelines.

== Proper Trademark Use

One of our purposes is to make cutting-edge versions of Java Middleware widely available in a consistent format that the public can come to trust. To achieve this purpose it is important that the technology can quickly be identified and that the recipient knows the technology they are receiving is the official and unmodified version. Red Hat has chosen a number of project names to identify this effort and is granting usage rights in the Project Trademarks as previously described in this document in order to assure widespread availability.

You can access this new helpful resource at the following URL: .  Key features include:   * FEEL built-in functions organised by category  * tested and integrated FEEL examples  * Responsive design: easily access on Mobile, Tablet and Desktop from your    favourite browser!  ‚Ä¶and many more!   IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  For the technically curious, this section will highlight some of the technical implementation choices for the realisation of this handbook.  If you want to just use this handbook, you are free to skip this section! üôÇ  The framework used to render this handbook is called ; it‚Äôs very convenient to use it when, in general, you want a neat API documented with use-cases and examples. This makes it a perfect framework candidate to build a technical manual of a very specific aspect ‚Äìthe FEEL expression language of DMN. Naturally we‚Äôre keeping Antora for the general documentation of Drools, which is more powerful for the user-manuals and modularising content.  Then, in order to CI the FEEL snippets and examples in the handbook, we‚Äôre leveraging the awesome ! As you can see in the Java_script source () we‚Äôre parsing the content of the Markdown file to search for codeblocks related to FEEL. Each codeblock related to FEEL is then evaluated, to make sure it does not error or misbehave.  This allowed us to catch small typos, which we corrected in the main docs. I got the inspiration to implement this approach by reading the Rust manual. If you are familiar with that book, you will likely recognise where :).  Finally, we integrated the JBang! tests with CI with a , and then we serve the content via GitHub Pages.   CONCLUSIONS  Don‚Äôt forget to checkout this DMN FEEL handbook today!    Do you like it?

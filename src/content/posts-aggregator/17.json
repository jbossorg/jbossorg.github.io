  "content": "Quarkus 3.17 is a smaller release than 3.16 but we polished and improved a lot of areas.  Notable changes are:   * - Integrate OpenTelemetry to the WebSockets Next extension   * - OpenTelemetry - Add SimpleSpanProcessor support   * - Update MicroProfile REST Client to 4.0   * - Add annotation to allow using custom CDI bean methods as permission    checkers   * - Use ArC features in datasource extensions for eager startup and    active/inactive   * - Adapt locales support for GraalVM >= 24.2  There won’t be any new minor releases in December but we will release new micros of 3.17.  Next minor 3.18 will be released at the end of January.   UPDATE  To update to Quarkus 3.17, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:  quarkus update  Note that quarkus update can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.17.  For more information about the adjustments you need to make to your applications, please refer to the .   WHAT’S NEW?   OBSERVABILITY  In relation to observability, we would like to highlight new features:   * Support for in the extension.   * OpenTelemetry Simple Processors for traces and logs on Quarkus. This is    important for lambda functions and other short-lived processes because it    allows sending telemetry faster, not batching it, therefore minoring the risk    of losing data.   * MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 support by adding automatic JVM and HTTP request    metrics to the OpenTelemetry extension.   MICROPROFILE REST CLIENT 4.0  The Quarkus REST Clients have been updated to MicroProfile REST Client 4.0.   SECURITY  We added more flexibility to how you define your permissions by allowing to point to CDI bean methods for permission checking.  This solution is the Quarkus equivalent to the Expression Language support you can find in some other frameworks. Expression Language expressions are brittle and hard to debug and robust permission checking is critical, thus why we prefer you write your permission checking in plain Java.  You can find more detailed information about this new feature in the .   INACTIVE DATASOURCES  A lot of work went into ArC, our CDI implementation, and our datasource support to make sure we would avoid a lot of corner cases when a datasource is inactive.  For instance:   * We make sure inactive datasources don’t contribute to health checks.   * We fail fast if some code tries to inject an inactive datasource.  You can find more information about this work in the .   LOCALE SUPPORT  Our Mandrel team is working tirelessly to make sure Quarkus stays compatible with the future versions of GraalVM/Mandrel.  We adapted our locale support to be compatible with GraalVM >= 24.2 and you can find all the gory details in the corresponding .

It means that users would be able to run our extensions on this platform as well.  Since then, we have been looking forward to seeing this feature enabled in . For those not familiar with gitpod.io, it basically provides a fully online development environment for you to work in your code on top of eclipse-theia. Learn more about Gitpod and about all its features.  Online development environments are a recent trend in the industry and can potentially be a game-changer for developers. And you can leverage that to develop your Business Automation assets. Check out how to do that!  Photo by on    1-) ACCESS YOUR CODE  The first step is to go to your repository. Gitpod supports GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. It gives you the flexibility to host your project wherever you want.  In this post, I’ll be using , which contains a maven project created from the .  GitHub repository example.   2-) START GITPOD.IO  The second step is to add gitpod.io/# as prefix to your repository URL and simply open it.  In my case, I’m accessing gitpod.io/#.  The first time you access Gitpod, you’ll be asked to log in with GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. After doing so, Gitpod will automatically create a workspace for you and open your repository in the IDE.  Starting up your workspace on gitpod.io.

Project built within Gitpod using the terminal.  I can also start up Quarkus in development mode. To do so, I can run mvn clean package quarkus:dev -DskipTests on the terminal. Then, I can access the SwaggerUI to test my model. Remember, I didn’t install anything on my machine as all those things are in the cloud! Awesome, am I right?  Starting up Quarkus in development mode and accessing the SwaggerUI.  You can even set the service to be publicly available and share the SwaggerUI URL for others to try!  And that’s all for today.

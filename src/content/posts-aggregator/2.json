Learn about the power of intelligent applications by combining the robustness of Java, the efficiency of Quarkus, and the advanced capabilities of RAG in a great article by Daniel Oh. Emil Lefkof gives a real-world example of how LangChain4j and AI can be leveraged to automatically extract structured metadata from PDF documents. Leveraging the combination of LangChain4j and Google Gemini AI proves to be a powerful approach for automating document analysis workflows. \"Performance & Productivity: Rethinking Java Dependencies for the Cloud Era\" by Markus Eisele discusses how Quarkus extensions are curated, lightweight, and optimized for microservices and serverless.

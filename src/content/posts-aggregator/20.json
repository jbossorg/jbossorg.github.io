STEP 1: DROOLS APP CREATION WITH CODE.QUARKUS.IO  To generate the application as shown in the video, you can use this link:  The link will automatically populate for you the basic extensions needed to follow this tutorial.   STEP 2: MAINTAIN CONFIGURATION  In the application.properties file, you need to maintain a couple of required configuration, following this guideline:  quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=knative  quarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io quarkus.container-image.group=<your own account>  You may decide for the Container Image Registry to opt instead for docker.io or similar, and you will need to configure .   STEP 3: DEPLOY YOUR DROOLS SERVERLESS APP ðŸš€  To deploy on Kubernetes, my preference is to deliberately publish a Container Image on a Registry; to follow this strategy, you just need to issue a couple of commands on the terminal.  The first command will produce a Container Image for our Drools serverless application, and publish it on the Registry:  mvn clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true  Then, the second command will effectively deploy that image on the OpenShift cluster:  kubectl apply -f target/kubernetes/knative.yml  Thanks to Knative, we have autoscaling including autoscale-to-zero, as itâ€™s shown in the video!  Autoscale to zero in action, for the Drools serverless app   BONUS: SWAGGER UI OPENAPI  If you want to use Swagger UI and the OpenAPI web based GUI in your deployed app, simply add quarkus-smallrye-openapi in the , and then maintain the application.properties configuration:  quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true   WANT TO LEARN MORE?  We hope you enjoyed this lighthearted tutorial ðŸ˜„  Did you know that formal training is available from Red Hat? teaches you how to develop, deploy, and auto-scale event driven serverless applications on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Read the course page to .   CONCLUSIONS  We have create a simple Drools serverless app with just 3 steps thanks to Kogito and Quarkus; then, thanks to OpenShift Serverless based on Kubernetes and Knative capabilities, we have autoscaling applied, including scale-to-zero.  You can use your own Kubernetes cluster while following this tutorial, but donâ€™t forget you can use a free to replicate all the steps exactly as shown in the video!

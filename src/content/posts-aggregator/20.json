We continued with our quarterly releases and delivered 4 Major versions (31, 32, 33, 34) and 5 micro updates. WildFly 35 Beta also just came out last week.  There were many developments done this year but here are some of the highlights from our :  Stability levels  The WildFly project has high standards related to quality, stability and backwards compatibility. A key way an open source project like WildFly can ensure high standards are met is by \"community bake\", allowing interested users to have access to features that are still undergoing a hardening process, while not forcing users who are not interested in such things to consume them. To better facilitate this, WildFly 31 introduced the notion of formal \"stability levels\" that can be associated with functionality.  MicroProfile 7.0  We have added support for MicroProfile 7.0 with inclusion of updated specifications for MicroProfile Fault Tolerance, MicroProfile OpenAPI, MicroProfile REST Client and MicroProfile Telemetry.  Jakarta EE 11  Work on support of Jakarta EE 11 is ongoing with inclusion of preview stability support for in both standard WildFly and WildFly Preview, in addition to the updates of Jakarta EE 10 APIs in WildFly Preview.  WildFly Glow  The WildFly Glow tools (a CLI application and a Maven plugin) will analyze your application artifact, determine what WildFly feature-packs and Galleon layers are needed to run your application, and make suggestions about other features (e.g. TLS support) that you may want to include in your optimized WildFly installation. You can take the information WildFly Glow provides and use it in your own provisioning configuration, or you can have WildFly Glow provision a server, bootable jar or Docker image for you.  Jakarta MVC  We have added a preview stability extension and subsystem for .  Vert.x extension  We have added a preview stability extension and subsystem for to configure and share the Vert.x instance within WildFly server for other subsystems which need it.  WildFly AI  We have created a for Generative AI that simplifies the integration of AI in WildFly applications.  Overall, more than 300 feature, enhancement and bug issues were resolved in our main code by more than 60 contributors, and if you include task and component upgrade issues we resolved over 700. This is not counting all the work done in the components integrated in WildFly.  We have updated our release process with an emphasis on to enhance and expand WildFly.  We continued to expand our to cover more use cases.  We also organized two mini conferences around WildFly in March and November:   *    *   We will start 2025 with the release of WildFly 35 and we have a lot of exciting news for the future of WildFly!  Thanks all for of your for your work and help in making WildFly a successful Open Source project. We are looking forward to continuing working with you next year!  Best wishes from the WildFly team and Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ!  Brian"

WILDFLY PREVIEW AND EE 11  Since the , we are using WildFly Preview to provide a look at what we’re doing for Jakarta EE 11 support. The EE 11 Platform and Web Profile specifications won’t go GA before later this year. But there are milestone, Release Candidate and Final releases of many EE 11 specs and implementations available, so we are providing those in WildFly Preview. This means for a number of EE APIs, WildFly Preview no longer provides an EE 10 compatible implementation.

While we recommend using an LTS JDK release, I do believe WildFly runs well on SE 24. By runs well, I mean the main WildFly testsuite runs with no more than a few . We want developers who are trying to evaluate what a newer JVM means for their applications to be able to look to WildFly as a useful development platform. We’ve also had good results with tests on Linux of an EA release of SE 25 (Oracle 25-ea+10-1084).  Please note that WildFly runs in classpath mode.

NEW WILDFLY S2I AND RUNTIME MULTI-ARCH IMAGES  These new multi-arch images (linux/arm64 in addition to linux/amd64) have a different naming scheme than the current WildFly images to better handle multiple JDK versions and align with the tag scheme used for the WildFly centos7 docker images (as explained in blog post).  Note The previous WildFly images are now deprecated and are no longer updated.  The new multi-arch image names are:   * Runtime image: quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:<tag>   * S2I builder image: quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:<tag>  This change is described in this .  In short, the WildFly image names used to contain the JDK version (e.g: wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11) leading to some lack of flexibility:   * An increasing number of new images for each new JDK version.   * No ability to identify a pair of images supporting the latest LTS (Long Term    Support) JDK.  The JDK version has been removed from the image name and moved to the image tag. In addition we have introduced a latest tag that identifies the images supporting the latest LTS JDK.  You can identify the exact images version supporting a given JDK version:   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:1.0.0-jdk11 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk11:1.0.0   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:1.0.0-jdk17 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk17:1.0.0   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:1.0.0-jdk11 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11:1.0.0   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:1.0.0-jdk17 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk17:1.0.0  You can identify the latest images supporting a given JDK version:   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:latest-jdk11 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk11:latest   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:latest-jdk17 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk17:latest   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:latest-jdk11 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11:latest   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:latest-jdk17 used to be    quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk17:latest  You can now identify the latest image supporting the latest LTS JDK version (JDK 17 at the time of this writing):   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:latest   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:latest  Note Relying on this image tag implies that the JDK version will get automatically updated when a new LTS JDK is released and supported by the WildFly images.   DEPRECATED SNAPSHOT MULTI-ARCH IMAGES  Up to now, we were releasing multi-arch images as preview ones in the quay.io/wildfly-snapshots organization:   * quay.io/wildfly-snapshots/wildfly-runtime-jdk11-multi-arch:latest   * quay.io/wildfly-snapshots/wildfly-runtime-jdk17-multi-arch:latest   * quay.io/wildfly-snapshots/wildfly-s2i-jdk11-multi-arch:latest   * quay.io/wildfly-snapshots/wildfly-s2i-jdk17-multi-arch:latest  These images are now deprecated and no longer updated.   DEPRECATED WILDFLY IMAGES  The following single-arch images are now deprecated and are no longer updated:   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk11:<tag>   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-jdk17:<tag>   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11:<tag>   * quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk17:<tag>   NEW OPENSHIFT IMAGE STREAMS  The previous image streams (, , , ) have been deprecated.  The new image streams are:   * WildFly s2i builder:   * WildFly runtime:   IMPACT ON HELM CHARTS FOR WILDFLY  version 2.3.1 is required to use these new images.  Helm Chart for WildFly now uses the quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i:latest and quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime:latest (latest LTS JDK) by default, used to be JDK11.  If you have already installed the Helm Charts for WildFly, make sure to update your repository to the latest version. This is done by calling:  helm repo update   USING THE IMAGES  The image naming change is transparent when using Helm Charts for WildFly. Usage of these images is covered by WildFly S2I , , wildfly-s2i image and wildfly-runtime image .   SUMMARY  With the introduction of these new multi-arch images, we are putting in place a long term tagging scheme to better support future JDK versions. You feedback as always is very welcome. Feel free to log these as new .  Thank-you!  JF Denise"

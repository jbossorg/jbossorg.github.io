  "content": "Explore how to combine Quarkus, a modern Java framework optimized for cloud-native applications, with Ollama, a platform for running AI models locally with Jonathan Vilaâ€™s article \"Building local LLM AI-Powered Applications with Quarkus, Ollama and Testcontainers\". Long Term Support (LTS) releases are designed for users who want to keep a given version for a longer period of time instead of following our monthly release pace. Quarkus 3.20 will be our next LTS version planned for release in late March. Read more about it in the blog post \"Our next LTS will be Quarkus 3.20\" from Guillaume Smet. Customizing your test resource manager and using a unified configuration, you can eliminate conflicts between the containers used by Liquibase and your application. Learn how in \"Resolving Issues with Quarkus Tests, Test Containers, and Liquibase Integration\" by tempmailgenerator on Reddit.  You will also see the latest Quarkus Insights episodes, top tweets/discussions and upcoming Quarkus attended events.  Check out !  Want to get newsletters in your inbox? using the on page form."

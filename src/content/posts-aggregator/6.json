  "content": "Last month, we reached an important milestone for our community: 20k+ active users for our BPMN VS Code Extension.  It has been a long road since our first prototype in . After several releases and incremental iterations, we are proud to develop the most popular for VS Code.  Under the hood, the BPMN editor is based on Stunner.

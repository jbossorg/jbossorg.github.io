  "content": "NODE.JS CLIENT 0.10.0  Infinispan Node.js client version 0.10.0 was released last week with added support of query with application/x-protostream data format. Up until now, our Node.js client only supported text/plain and application/json data formats.  APPLICATION/X-PROTOSTREAM DATA FORMAT  You can now use the application/x-protostream data format for all the Hot Rod operations supported in js-client. To make the Node.js client backwards compatible, the client still treats key/value pairs as String by default.  QUERY  The Hot Rod js-client now also supports query method to perform queries on caches. For more information about querying infinispan caches, refer to .  Important You must set the data-format as application/x-protostream to perform queries on your cache.  For the working code example of the query feature, please refer to .   TO GO FURTHER  Full client documentation is now available in the .  Jira tracker for this client is available ."

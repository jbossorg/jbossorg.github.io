Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.

== Releases!!

.Infinispan 12 Final

Infinispan 12 release, codenamed `Lockdown`, brings a ton of new features and improvements.
Indexing and querying capabilities have seen a number of improvements with the help of Hibernate Search integration.
ProtoStream marshalling is upgraded with a new `@ProtoAdapter` annotation that lets you easily integrate third-party classes.
It's a pretty elegant solution to what could present itself as a real headache for developers.
Speaking of marshalling improvements, Infinispan 12 also makes your life easier by automatically generating and registering `SerializationContextInitializer` implementations to marshall user types.
Also notable is the SPI for cross-site replication merge conflicts, which continues on the brilliant work that team has done to provide a solution for ensuring data integrity.
There's a lot going on in Infinispan 12 and probably too much to try and sum up here so why not head over and read all the details in the link:https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/01/25/infinispan-12-final[Infinispan 12.0.0.Final Announcement].

Congratulations to the entire Infinispan team on all the hard work.

.Quarkus 1.11

link:https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-0-final-released/[Quarkus 1.11] is here!
This release brings you RESTEasy Reactive, which is a new JAX-RS implementation for writing RESTful services.
Quarkus 1.11 also introduces the Dev UI so you can quickly visualize all your loaded extensions, access docs, and more.
Of course there are other things in Quarkus 1.11 but RESTEasy Reactive and the Dev UI look to be quite promising indeed.

The Quarkus team keep things rolling with the release of link:https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.3.0/[Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.3.0] that adds codestarts to the Quarkus project wizard.

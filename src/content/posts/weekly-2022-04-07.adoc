== .Net core client for Infinispan

link:https://infinispan.org/blog/2022/03/22/dotnetcore-0-0-3-beta[Infinispan .Net Core Client], by Vittorio Rigamonti

Vittorio Rigamonti has made a beta release of his .Net core client that allows access to remote caches on Infinispan clusters.
The client provides .Net core applications with the performance benefits of in-memory data storage.
Combined with the Protobuf data encoding Vittorio's client also gives .Net core applications data interoperability with Java applications that can access the same Infinispan caches.
Using Protobuf with the .Net core client lets you perform remote queries as an added bonus!

Go check out Vittorio's post and use his link:https://github.com/infinispan/Infinispan.Hotrod.Core/tree/main/Infinispan.Hotrod.Application[sample application] to get started coding.
While you're at it, you might find Vittorio's other blog post on https://infinispan.org/blog/2022/01/21/dotnet-core-query[performing remote queries] useful.

== Inside out event streaming with microservice architectures

link:http://www.ofbizian.com/2022/04/turning-microservices-inside-out.html[Turning Microservices Inside-Out], by Bilgin Ibryam

This excellent read from Bilgin starts with recent ideas about the design of relational databases and their place in the event-driven world of microservice architectures.
Bilgin makes his point that, rather than replacing relational databases with event streams, the inside out design principle is better applied to the service level.
Using traditional databases with an event-driven approach allows you to combine the best of both technologies but requires a deliberate focus on APIs.
From there Bilgin explains the flow of events through outbound and inbound APIs and how a "connecting tissue" such as Debezium can help you effectively bring relational databases into event-driven microservices.

== Camel Quarkus: the Swiss knife of integration

link:https://quarkus.io/blog/camel-quarkus-effortless-apis/[Riding Camel Quarkus: effortless APIs], by Bruno Meseguer

Bruno showcases Camel Quarkus in an extensive post that will leave anyone working on service integration how they could live without it.

Using the OpenAPI specification as an example Bruno explains how to use Camel Quarkus to connect to an HTTP service and transform data in a few effortless steps.
There's a lot to discover in his post and Bruno even walks you through a second iteration of his application in which he reduces the path to integration even further.

I think by the end Bruno proves his point, that Camel Quarkus really is a Swiss knife for service integration.
He offers a compelling look at how reducing integration overhead lowers maintenance costs and accelerates development cycles for rapid functionality growth.


== Quickly debug and profile MySQL databases

link:http://www.mastertheboss.com/jbossas/jboss-datasource/how-to-trace-jdbc-statements-performance-in-mysql/[How to trace JDBC Statements performance in MySQL], by Francesco Marchioni

Francesco shows us how to quickly debug and profile SQL statements with Java applications using the MySQL JDBC driver.
Using the WildFly CLI Francesco adds a JDBC connection to MySQL database in a container in a few simple steps.
After creating the datasource he demonstrates the `hibernate.show_sql` option in the application's `persistence.xml`.
Once that's done you can find all sorts of useful information about SQL statements in your logs.
You're all set to debug and tune!

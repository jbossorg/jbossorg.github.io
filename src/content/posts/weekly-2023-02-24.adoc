Welocme back everyone!
I don't know about where you happen to be, but where I'm living, we had the second largest snow storm in recorded weather history.
I've been digging out my driveway and front door for a couple of days.
Needless to say, it has been a bit cold here.

Also, my thoughts go out to those affected by the war between Russia and Ukraine, on this one year anniversary.
Please stay as safe as you can.
